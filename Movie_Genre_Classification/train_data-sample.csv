Moore, a Flint native, wrote and directed the documentary Roger and Me about the darker side of capitalism and General Motors. Omar McGee, another Flint native, picks up where Moore left off with Flint Town Kids, a documentary showing the African American dark side of Flint. Flint is predominantly populated by African Americans who migrated from the south after Reconstruction. Flint can be viewed as a microcosm of America's poverty stricken urban areas. Once abandoned by General Motors, Flint became one of the poorest urban areas in the country. Flint Town Kids captures the bleak setting in which these Flint natives exist. It powerfully examines the hardships, the sufferings, mishaps and sacrifices made in order to persist in this town. Flint Town Kids highlights the frightening education system in Flint where schools are designed to produce basketball players only. On the other hand, students who are non basketball players are left with mediocre excuses for classrooms while adjusting to the lack of libraries needed to empower young minds. The documentary takes a very close look at children who bare the armor of strength in trying to escape Flint.

For those who are not as fortunate to escape the nightmarish lifestyle that Flint brings, they embark on survival methods such as drugs and violence. Flint Town Kids brings to light the little faith left in the system. Children raising kids and kids age ten killing each other is just an everyday part of life in Flint. The documentary will depict those shocking scenes in the lives of children who are left with no choice but to make adult decisions in a world where only the fittest survive. For many adults the consuming goal of overcoming poverty lies in making cocaine. Flint Town Kids graphically explores this process which seems to have become the saving grace for many in a town that presents scarce positive outcomes for the future. Flint Town Kids will leave audiences outraged and enthralled with the African American lifestyle in an area that once presented promise only miles from the Motor City. Follow-up to Dollar Bill Y'All. Story revolves around the youth on the streets of Flint, Michigan and the choices they face. Several Flintown Kids grow up to be ballers, jumping right from high school to the NBA while others are faced to find other ways off the streets, like selling drugs and resorting to violence.

448,Guidance Is Internal (2016),short,"Two people find themselves on the precipice of romance. Their personal convergence parallels NASA's exploration of space and echoes of JFK's once and future dream. Specifically the Apollo 11 voyage to the moon and JFK's 1962 speech ennobling cosmic quests are entwined with our characters' encounter. The micro and macro of human life are showcased through cross-cutting techniques. Both narratives underscore our film's essential theme; that love is the essence of all exploration and it is indeed the greatest adventure of all. Space exploration of all scales is born out of our internal need to connect externally. The title, ""Guidance is Internal"", was originally uttered during the Apollo 11 launch countdown and serves as a thematic bridge between the two stories. On one hand, we have two characters whose internal desire to connect catalyzes their external actions to communicate. On the other hand, we have the culminating efforts of humanity literally reaching for the stars in hopes of better understanding our place in the universe. Ultimately, what does each existential excursion into the unknown grant us? An understanding that we are not alone. For our two characters, their connection is forged by a mutual understanding and feeling for life. For the human race, witnessing our planet from the heavens imbues in us with an understanding of our innate interconnectivity. In both cases, a greater harmony is achieved. This is the story of two potential lovers (Collin Varney and Sondra Glass) on a journey to connect, interwoven with the Apollo 11 Moon landing and JFK's rousing 1962 speech at Rice University. The over-arching theme of our interconnectivity through exploration and our subsequent place in the universe is personified through these duel narratives."

Tijuana has media links to both Mexico and the United States, with peoples, currencies, and cultural goods--perhaps especially music--from both sides circulating intensely within the city. Older residents and their more mobile, cosmopolitan-minded children thus engage in a constant struggle with identity and nationality, appropriation and authenticity. Nor-tec music in its very composition encapsulates this city's struggle, resonating with issues felt on the global level, while holding vastly different meanings to the variety of communities that embrace it. With an impressive hybrid of musicology, ethnomusicology, cultural and performance studies, urbanism, and border studies, this documentary explores all facets."

In Borneo, one of their last island outposts, lives one today who is a legend. He's won more than just a kingdom, he's won human hearts. They gave him the name Kusasi. The Orangutan King is the story of Kusasi's life told to us by a remarkable witness. Dr Birute M. Galdikas has been researching orangutans in Borneo for over 40 years. Under the guidance of Louis Leakey, Galdikas joined Jane Goodall and Dian Fossey to become a pioneer of Great Ape field research. Together they were known as the 'trimates', or 'Leakey's Angels'. Yet while Goodall's chimpanzees and Fossey's gorillas were made familiar through films, the orangutans are still largely unknown to television audiences. Their solitary lives high in the tree canopy have made them difficult to follow and film. Now, for the first time, Dr Galdikas will draw audiences deep into the orangutan universe. With enthusiasm and insight she tells us this special story - taking us back 30 years and unfolding Kusasi's story with detail, energy, and the wonder that she still feels for the orangutan species. As a three year old orphan, Kusasi fell under the care of Galdikas in her forest research camp. But driven by a cunning and tenacious spirit Kusasi did not behave as the other ex-captive infants. From the moment he arrived until today, Galdikas has watched Kusasi fight to win back and then succeed at life in the wild. And he's achieved what had once seemed impossible, reaching the top of the power hierarchy and ruling for ten years. The people who work at Camp Leakey enjoy his charisma, and even those who only visit him in his forest kingdom are struck with awe. As Julia Roberts was in 1997. Her encounter with Kusasi was unplanned - becoming a tight clinch with an irritable 140 kilo beast, possessing the strength of ten men. But she was unharmed. Kusasi is not malicious, and he's respected as much for his indifference to humans as for his power over the other orangutans. Today his spirit still burns brightly but his physical strength is fading. His fights with the rogue males who cross his borders are weakening him and The Orangutan King is the last chance for us to see him in power. But the hope of this film is that he will not be the last of his kind to rule with such strength in his forests. If the forest destruction can be stopped, there is a long future for the considerable Kusasi bloodline."

The film then shifts to Chicago, where the birds are held in quarantine at a remote site while the final touches are being put on the new building and seabird habitat they will live in. Here we join the building's architect and engineer as they guide us through the unique design, construction, and layers of complex technology and machinery required to create in terrain, temperature, and lighting of an exacting replica of Iceland ideal for the North Atlantic puffin, but located in the heart of Chicago's cityscape.

1202,Exquisite Corpses (2011),short,"Exquisite Corpses is a formal study that alludes to the decay of cinema and the advancing of digital film through a series of devolving images from the history of photography, and early motion picture technology. Director Dana Plays uses random chance operations of the exquisite corpse, by creating vertical triptychs, and mixed frame combinations, of stacked motion picture footage of Muybridge's horse in motion, Edison early toys with her own footage shot with a 16mm camera of the subway train arriving at the station, and animal locomotion study she shot in high speed digital cinematography. The exquisite corpse was a word and picture game used by the surrealists and later a child's game that evolved into a triptych of a drawing made with a paper folded in threes. Ultimately the film is a reflexive comment on narrativity as it interweaves image and text, of Plays' evolving historical project, the story of Ottilie Moore, her great aunt who provided safe haven for refuges, including the Jewish at Villa L'Hermitage, in Villefranche sur- Mer, in the late 30s and early 40s. Through complex structural and formal approaches, including vertical and horizontal structures, Plays visually explores the intersections between private and public histories, making metaphorical connections between location, setting and place, oral and written story telling and refers to the devolving process of history of motion picture film, from the silent era with use of inter-title text and image combinations. This piece was made by Plays using her digital JK Optical Printer optical printer to reprocess found footage she salvaged from dumpsters. The piece has evolved from a series of digital installations exhibited in Prague, Czech Republic, at the Skolska 28 Gallery, and an earlier permutation of this piece exhibited as part of the Film Lingual II exhibition, at C. Emerson Fine Arts Gallery in St. Petersburg Florida curated by Lori Johns."

This is the comic tale of four identical pieces of red plaid luggage and one San Francisco hotel, in the spirit of Howard Hawks but made by Peter Bogdanovich. One bag contains secret government files, another has expensive jewels and a third has igneous rocks. It is unclear what is in the fourth bag, carried by the would-be erudite Judy Maxwell...but all four bags end up at the Hotel Bristol. Judy has a yen for food and Dr. Howard Bannister and no ""off"" button. Dr. Bannister (deliciously deadpan and hunky, Ryan O'Neal) has a yen for igneous rock formations.

It's love at first sight for Judy, who does whatever she can to insinuate herself into Howard's life. Further complications ensue as Howard, Judy, wealthy Mrs. Van Hoskins and reporter Mr. Smith - the latter two who are staying at the same hotel as Howard - all have the identical red plaid overnight bag respectively carrying Howard's igneous rocks, Judy's clothes, Mrs. Van Hoskins jewels and top secret government documents, the latter two which are eyed by others who are trying to get their hands on the contents."

The eccentric brotherhood of attendants consist of grad students, overeducated philosophers, surly artists, middle-age slackers and more. This self-described ""ragtag group of fractured poets"" prefer skateboards and bicycles to cars and have at best a tolerant contempt for the people they serve. That's not to say they don't care about anything. They hang out at the lot even in their spare time, shooting the breeze or playing a spirited game of ""flip cone,"" just because...they like it there. They conduct their own private ""war"" against the elites, the pretentious and obnoxious customers who park their BMWs, Hummers, Suburbans and other vehicles. They study the art of doing nothing and the knack of getting even with rude, SUV-driving dolts who treat them like inferior beings. The gradual devolution from enthusiasm to resentment in the psyches of guys self-aware enough to notice it is an interesting process; in an attempt to distract themselves from the rapidly mounting bitterness, the attendants amuse themselves any way they can-stenciling random messages on the parking gate, writing songs, even dancing for tips. Through interviews with former attendants who have moved on - we see that their time at the lot has clearly provided rites of passage and afforded them Zen-like perspective.

1507,Everyday Life's Changing Moods (2008),short,"The film Everyday life's changing moods is a kind of search for personal maps of our hidden thoughts during the process of creation. Just like in a diary moments in everyday life are revealed in this film as a site of desires and fears, but in its essence it explores ideas which are constructing (or deconstructing) any work of art. Everyday life's changing moods is made out of intertwined visual and textual elements. However, the subconscious treatment of text in contrast to the conscious use of visual narrative forces the elements to oppose each other. The text becomes a gesture and visual images turn to contents. Both words and pictures are leading to disruption of a fine line between public and private making the clear reading of present reality unable. The film examines the interconnections between me and others; gender and identity illustrated as our connection to the external world as we search for the internal. Through simulated reality, simulated personal point of view, false surrealism, through words and sentences which strive to reconstruct tacitly the visual, the main issues of this film are: simulations of ability to be aware of feelings and imaginations through processes of creation. The intimacy of the artist is brought to be public - this procedure reveals itself as primarily artistic method in producing any work of art."

Specializing in what he calls ""info-tainment,"" Conal's posters offer an immediate response to today's headlines through the expressionistically decaying depiction of the socially and politically powerful accompanied by several words of dichotomous text. Beginning in 1986 with the onset of the Iran-Contra scandal, Conal has distributed his work in a way even Andy Warhol might not have dreamed possible. As Conal modestly points out, ""these are some of the most famous paintings of any contemporary artist because I make you see them whether you want to or not."" The original canvases, from which the posters are reproduced, simultaneously grace elite gallery walls and wealthy collectors' homes. Post No Bills foregrounds the tension between Conal's creative process and the lures of a desperate notoriety achieved through catering to the newsmedia's craving for controversy in his journey to express himself and benefit from the notoriety generated from his endeavors. In September 1990, after ""reasonably outspoken"" Los Angeles Police Chief Daryl F. Gates casually stated that ""casual drug users ought to be taken out and shot,"" Conal began collaboration with student Patrick Crowley on a poster criticizing this hyperbolic remark. When an outraged world focused on Los Angeles in March of 1991 with the release of the graphic video footage of the beating of Rodney King by Los Angeles police officers, Conal and Crowley took to the L.A. streets his most daring, inciting and inflammatory image to date; a poster depicting the police chief on a full torso N.R.A. shooting target with the text ""casual drug users ought to be taken out and beaten. Post No Bills concentrates on this poster of Gates, including an interview with the beleaguered Chief himself, celebrating the potential of this piece of political street art and exposing the dissociation to be made between Conal and his subject matter. A documentary look at artist Robbie Conal. Conal paints political posters and then organizes gangs of folks to plaster them up all over town. The film visits his L.A. studio as he paints and as he turns out posters; he talks about his work. We also watch his volunteers out on the streets putting up the posters, and we see the cityscape decorated with his art. The soundtrack includes public utterances by Ronald Reagan, George Bush, Ollie North, Tammy Faye Baker, and others whom Conal's guerrilla art skewers."

Sometimes we find ourselves in these situations where - if we approach with respect and an open ear - we afford ourselves the opportunity to collaborate, to further the conversation, to build valuable relationships. We are a global network of experts seeking to further our innovative insight through our innate curiosity, our collaborative nature, and our respect for the work and achievements of others. As an example of this, a handful of IBMers over the last few years have visited the MIT SENSEable City Laboratory in Cambridge Massachusetts to meet with the students and faculty members there, and to learn about some of the innovative projects they have underway. Just as IBM has been exploring how to make our cities more instrumented, interconnected and intelligent, the folks at MIT have been investigating and testing their own ideas in a number of cities over the last 6 years. Their projects are fascinating. One project from the SENSEable Cities Lab that has caught the eye of many IBMers over the past few years is called Trash Track. In a nutshell, this project involved attaching RFID tags to everyday garbage items so that the geographic movement of the trash could be tracked for up to a year depending on variables. An Internet of Things project of sorts, with mapping, analytics, and ultimately analysis of the tags as attached to their hosts traveling about -- glass, metals, plastics, organic waste etc -- this project provided unique and surprising lessons for all involved. In hearing about this project, IBM Fellow John Cohn agreed to take a trip to the MIT campus -- his alma mater -- to participate in a discussion with SENSEable Cities Associate Director Assaf Biderman to learn more about Trash Track. This video is the result of that trip, and some of the things we learned that day."

2037,Marcelle Hanselaar: Postcard from the Edge (2013),short,"""POSTCARD FROM THE EDGE"" is a short but intimate portrait of the Dutch painter MARCELLE HANSELAAR directed by German filmmaker and artist Thomas Völker. The film was made on the occasion of Hanselaar's Solo Show ""Walking The Line"" which took place at Kings Place Gallery London between May and June 2013. From the exhibition catalogue: Marcelle Hanselaar's familiar theme, the conflicting awareness and subsequent struggle with the balance of how we see ourselves and how we appear to others, has now found a bigger arena. Her gripping paintings of a solitary figure, with or without props are still there but now, for the first time, she takes this theme into the public realm, something she has freely explored in her large etchings but never before in her paintings. The result is a Breughel-esque tableau vivant. Hanselaar says ""I am fascinated by the phenomena of crowds, how the shift from private to collective behavior creates a shift of inner boundaries as well. Our familiar sense of inner and outer or personal and social responsibilities and its subsequent behavior shrinks and expands simultaneously and creates, temporarily, a different set of references from which we then function."" Marcelle Hanselaar has won many awards both for her prints and her paintings. Her work is in important public collections including the British Museum, the Victoria & Albert Museum, the National Art Library and the Ruth Borchard Self-Portrait Collection."
2038,Eden Valley (1995),drama,"The film is set within a harness racing fraternity and explores the conflict between urban and rural values through the medium of an evolving relationship between father and son. The main character in the film, Hoggy, abandoned his wife and son ten years earlier to establish himself in an alternative lifestyle, living in a caravan and caring for his horses. The world gets turned upside down by the arrival of his teenage son, who has a prison sentence hanging over him. Billy has lived his life on an inner-city housing estate, and in his lifestyle theft and drugs are the norm. Using dramatic seasonal changes within the horse-trainer's environment we follow the development of this fragile relationship. Both father's and son's value systems are tested, with dramatic consequences. The roots of the film lie in the making of Seacoal, which was released in 1985. The film, depicted the lives of seacoalers on the Northumberland coast, and introduced members of Amber to a passion for horses, and the addictive pursuit of harness racing. The Laidler family, who were featured in Seacoal, proved to have a profound impact. It was they who talked us into buying our first horse, taught us the rudiments of training and driving, and encouraged our bartering and re-cycling skills. They wove the web that pulled us into the activity, and secured our entry into their environment and the world of harness racing. Our method of working is based on building long-term relationships within communities. Our aim is to enter into people's lives in a way that provides an authenticity to film-making that goes beyond simple realism. After becoming established in the harness racing community, we introduced actor Brian Hogg into it. His character, Hoggy, was developed over a period during which Brian immersed himself in the lifestyle, contributed to the development of the script, and participated in other essential tasks such as set building and horse training. In contrast, Darren Bell, who played Billy, his son, came directly into his first film role from a background of life on an inner-city housing estate. The film was shot sequentially to facilitate Billy's introduction into an initially alien environment and to reflect on the story of Billy. The film schedule spanned a twelve-month period. We worked with a small crew, two main characters and considerable good will from the harness racing community."

2248,A propos de America (2006),short,"""A Propos __ America"" is a visual approach to American -and therefore- the world's contemporary history covering the post 9/11 years up to the Katrina's disaster in Louisiana. It contains four short films and an introduction, all of them independent from each other in terms of structure, themes and motifs. Together, they form a cohesive piece, showing the American reality at the beginning of the third millennium. The introduction is a collage of interviews, where the confusion that reigns now in the country is manifested. The first film is a ride through the streets of Los Angeles which uncover, from a driver's P.O.V., the two sides of the city: the bright one, the one seen in almost every single Hollywood movie; and the dark one, the one that's almost never shown. As a whole, it illustrates the huge gap that still exists in American society. The second one is a walk trough the streets of New York and captures the tremendous power the city exerts on its inhabitants, as well as the unconditional love that almost all New Yorkers feel for their city-no matter their race, economic status or attitude towards life. It also shows the eerie energy felt in NYC after the 9/11 attack, which made people feel that something had changed the city forever. As a whole, it reveals the scar Americans will carry within them since those tragic events. The third piece, shot in Miami over a period of than more than two years, shows where and how Americans go when they want to have fun. We see how Americans interact, how they show themselves off and check each other out. We almost feel as if we were in a Latin American city when the film focuses on the Latin Quarter-which could be any part of the city. There, we see how Latinos (most of them American citizens) let loose with abandon and without inhibitions, not caring too much about how they may look and feel. I like this piece very much, mainly because it is homage to the city that adopted me more than three years ago. In a way, it shows how Americans, sometimes more often that not, feel like foreigners in their own country ""An Epilogue"", the last short movie, focuses on the most prevalent icon that appears in all the films and in American society: the stars and stripes flag, which unifies, for better or worse, all of the United States. The power of ""Ŕ Propos de America"", in my opinion, lies in its authenticity. The footage was stolen from real life, and with the skillful use of cinema techniques, has been assembled in a unique way that even for me, the director, is remarkably moving. Frankly, even with a Hollywood budget, I wouldn't have been able to reproduce this material. Life can be imitated but not repeated; and in this case, life isn't imitated. It just simply is."

In 1986, Peter Brock was a three-time Australian Touring Car Champion with eight Bathurst 1000 victories under his belt. Along with trusted Co-Driver, business partner and friend John Harvey by his side, Brock had become the most successful driver in Australian touring car history. Brock was always seeking an advantage over the competition, always adapting new technologies from overseas to push the very boundaries of the sport. On the advice of family friend and health practitioner Dr Eric Dowker, Brock sought to improve his own health and fitness. He gave up alcohol and cigarettes, and became a vegan literally overnight.

Against the wishes of his major partner and supplier of vehicles, General Motors Holden, he ordered the fitting of this new device to his Holden Special Vehicle Commodores.

It was a GMH based product and had not been approved. This was against GMH's wishes, who were already unimpressed with the much vaunted polarizer' device. GMH immediately withdrew all support for Brock's Racing Team. Overnight, his empire had collapsed. The Press had a field day, gleefully proclaiming he was yesterday's hero. Old loyalties were tested as friends became foes and with the World Touring Car Championship coming to Mount Panorama, a new breed of hot international driver was threatening to eclipse his legacy.

2492,The Italian Question (2012),documentary,"During the Second World War, as Canada was embroiled in violent conflict with the Axis Powers, nearly 25,000 Canadians of German, Italian and Japanese origin were arrested and interned as ""enemy aliens"". Internment, the indefinite imprisonment or confinement of a group of people in a time of crisis, was the Canadian government's reaction to a perceived threat posed by individuals of questionable loyalty. The Canadian government and public feared that if Italian, German and Japanese Canadians were disloyal, then they could commit sabotage and other subversive acts that would endanger lives and threaten the Canadian war effort. As the theory went, isolating disloyal citizens from the rest of the Canadian population contained the threat. Mass internment, especially of Japanese-Canadians, is undoubtedly a dark chapter in Canadian history. Over 20,000 Japanese-Canadians were subject to deprivation and displacement which was far out of proportion with the threat posed to Canada by that community. Historians and Japanese redress campaigners have rightfully labeled this a ""War on Ethnicity"". But what about the internment of Italian Canadians? Thousands of Italian Canadians were arrested in the wake of Fascist Italy's declaration of war on the United Kingdom and its allies in June 1940. The arrest and internment of Italian Canadians also had clear-cut repercussions for that community, some of which linger to the present day. The controversy and debate surrounding this issue is what historians and filmmakers refer to as ""The Italian Question""."

His detractors called him ""The Teflon President,"" because no criticism ever seemed to stick. But just about everybody agreed that Ronald Reagan was a great communicator -- a skilled public speaker who used confidence, style and wit to make his case and send a message. As a radio announcer, actor, corporate spokesman, governor, and finally as president, Reagan honed that message and built a following. His skill at communicating -- the ability to connect with people, and persuade them -- is among the things he is best remembered for today. Hosted by Brian Williams."
2543,East L.A. Marine: The Untold True Story of Guy Gabaldon (2008),documentary,"Guy Gabaldon died on August 31, 2006 and the world lost someone very special. During the bloody struggle for Saipan in July 1944, U.S. Marine PFC Guy Gabaldon is indeed officially credited with capturing over 1500 Japanese soldiers and civilians - singlehandedly, a record that is untouchable in the annals of American military history. For over sixty years, Guy talked about his exploits on that island, sharing his experience and using his celebrity to inspire new generations who valued bravery and bravado. However, war experience alone does not make a life, and Guy's didn't stop in 1944. He lived many different lives and most importantly he took it upon himself to help the less fortunate, particularly the wayward teenagers he encountered when he returned to the Mariana Islands in 1980, where he would live for twenty years. Guy Gabaldon grew up in East Los Angeles where he spent more time on the streets than at home. He would get into fights and he was thrown out of school at one point, but things began to change when he was introduced to the Japanese American community. Practically adopted by his Nisei school friends, Guy learned about the Japanese culture, its language, and the tight family structure that was alien to him. All of these elements - learned at first hand - would have a dramatic effect on his experiences on Saipan. When his Japanese American friends were interned after Pearl Harbor, Guy, 17, joined the Marine Corps, trained at Camp Pendleton, and was assigned as a scout to the 2nd Regiment of the 2nd Marine Division. His unit was then shipped to Hawaii, and then on into the Central Pacific, where he landed on Saipan, nine days after D-Day in Europe. Saipan was a rocky, cave-strewn island in the Mariana chain. It was part of the Japanese Empire's inner defense perimeter and it had an airfield within striking distance of Japan. It also had a large civilian population of Japanese and native islanders. The American high command in the Pacific had determined that the Marianas - Guam, Tinian and Saipan were a high priority for the war effort. B-29s were now flying and they needed a base to attack Japan. Saipan fit that bill. Guy Gabaldon didn't set out to be a hero. In the first few days of heavy fighting, he simply tried to survive murderous mortar, artillery and machine gun fire. But in succeeding days, he began to go on lone-wolf excursions into the countryside and he brought prisoners back. Japanese prisoners were a bit of an oddity at that time. The credo of most soldiers of the Japanese Army was kill or be killed. Japanese soldiers on Saipan were ordered to kill seven Marines for one Japanese. Thus, the campaign featured one suicide banzai charge after another. Capturing one Japanese was considered a feat - bringing in 1500 was unthinkable. But, amazingly, that's exactly what Guy Gabaldon did during the two months of early fighting on Saipan. At one point, he captured 800 in one day - his commanding officer Captain John Schwabe would later dub him ""The Pied Piper of Saipan."" How did Guy do it? Perhaps it was his language skill - Guy was hardly fluent in Japanese but he spoke the language with a certain inflection that reached into the psyche of the exhausted, hopelessly outnumbered island garrison. He had learned the words on the streets of L.A. with his Japanese-American friends, and those words helped him on the island. Perhaps it was the fact that the Japanese were, in the end, human beings who just couldn't fight anymore. Timing was thus everything. Guy wasn't hesitant to make a point with a hand grenade of a carbine if the enemy proved stubborn. But they eventually came out of their caves and became his prisoner. Guy was later wounded after the island was secured. Astonishingly, he was denied the Congressional Medal of Honor - a medal for which he was recommended by Captain Schwabe of the 2nd Marines. He did receive the Silver Star for his valor, but he was not promoted and left the Marine service as a PFC. Being Hispanic, perhaps, didn't help his cause. Racism and prejudice was rife throughout the U.S. armed forces in World War II and Guy was not immune to it. Guy returned to the United States, married a Japanese woman who was living in Mexico and became a successful pilot and importer. His story was first told on the television program ""This is your Life"" in the late 1950s. That program came to the attention of Hollywood and a movie was produced in 1960 entitled ""Hell to Eternity."" Actor Jeffrey Hunter played Guy. Hunter was your poster boy U.S. Marine - no reference was ever made to his Guy's Hispanic ethnicity. However, the notoriety of the film at that time encouraged the U.S. Navy to award Guy its highest decoration - the Navy Cross. But no Medal of Honor. Today, a strong effort is being waged by Congressmen, private business people and friends of Guy to get him the Medal. It would be measured as a sign of respect, not only to Guy, but to the people in America of Hispanic descent. Production Production on ""East L.A. Marine"" commenced in late 2003. Guy Gabaldon was enlisted as a creative partner on the project, and he was interviewed, at length, at his home outside Gainsville, Florida. We later interviewed his commanding officer, U.S. Marine Colonel John Schwabe, at his winter home in Tucson, Arizona. In June 2004, during the 60th Anniversary celebrations on Saipan, a local DV crew was hired and footage was gathered all over the island. Seventeen additional interviews were completed with returning veterans, local historians and friends of Guys. Guy and his wife had returned to the Island and lived there for many years - so he was well known throughout the Marianas. His autobiographical book Maverick Marine was published in 1990. Much of the footage that was gathered on the island is designed to match combat footage and still photographs taken of the campaign (yesterday and today shots). In early 2005, we interviewed a number of Hispanic veterans in Montebello, California. That May, we met Guy in Corpus Christi, Texas and helped celebrate Memorial Day with him. Footage of Guy participating in solemn commemorative ceremonies combined with nostalgic trips to the U.S.S. Lexington - a U.S. Essex-class aircraft carrier, that participated in the invasion of Saipan, sixty one years ago. In July 2006, Guy was honored by Mayor Antonio Villagairosa and the Los Angeles City Council. He was indeed a ""favorite son"" of the City of Los Angeles. This is the story of an extraordinary man - Guy Gabaldon - a U.S. Marine of Hispanic descent who single-handedly captured over 1100 Japanese during the bloody fighting on Saipan in the summer of 1944. One of the legendary heroes of World War II, Guy Gabaldon's true story is now told for the very first time in EAST L.A. MARINE: THE UNTOLD TRUE STORY OF GUY GABALDON. Guy Gabaldon's roots date back to the time of the Spanish conquistadors in New Mexico. Born in Los Angeles, Guy grew up in Boyle Heights where he spent more time on the streets than at home. He would get into fights and he was thrown out of school at one point, but things began to change when he was introduced to the Japanese American community. Practically adopted by his Nisei school friends, Guy learned about the Japanese culture, its language, and the tight family structure that was alien to him. All of these elements - learned at first hand - would have a dramatic effect on his experiences on Saipan. When his Japanese American friends were interned after Pearl Harbor, Guy, 17, joined the Marine Corps, trained at Camp Pendleton, and was assigned as a scout to the 2nd Regiment of the 2nd Marine Division. His combat unit landed on Saipan, nine days after D-Day in Europe. Saipan was a rocky, cave-strewn island in the Mariana chain. Guy Gabaldon didn't set out to be a hero. In the first few days of heavy fighting, he simply tried to survive murderous mortar, artillery and machine gun fire. But in succeeding days, he began to go on lone-wolf excursions into the countryside and he brought prisoners back. Japanese prisoners were an oddity at that time. The credo of most soldiers of the Japanese Army was kill or be killed. Japanese soldiers on Saipan were ordered to kill seven Marines for one Japanese. Thus, the campaign featured one suicide banzai charge after another. Capturing one Japanese was considered a feat - bringing in over 1500 was unthinkable. But, amazingly, that's exactly what Guy Gabaldon did during the two months of early fighting on Saipan. At one point, he captured 800 in one day - his commanding officer Captain John Schwabe would later dub him ""The Pied Piper of Saipan."" Guy was later wounded after the island was secured. Astonishingly, he was denied the Congressional Medal of Honor - a medal for which he was recommended by Captain Schwabe of the 2nd Marines. He did receive the Silver Star for his valor, but he was not promoted and left the Marine service as a PFC. Being Hispanic, perhaps, didn't help his cause. Racism and prejudice was rife throughout the U.S. armed forces in World War II and Guy was not immune to it. Fifteen years after the end of World War II, Guy's story was dramatized in the 1960 war film, HELL TO ETERNITY. Since there were no Hispanic leading men at that time, producer Irvin Levin decided to cast Jeffrey Hunter as Guy. Hunter was 6'1"" and Caucasian, a poster-boy Marine type. In reality, Guy ""Gabby"" Gabaldon was 5' 3 3/4"" and of Hispanic descent - an important facet of Guy's life that was ignored in the film. Although nicely written by Ted Sherdeman and directed in slam bang style by Phil Karlson (the movie was the first to feature on-screen squib bullet hits on bodies), much of the story was invented and the manner in which General Matsui (""Bridge on the River Kwai's"" Sessue Hayakawa) personally ordered the whole island to surrender to Guy was ludicrous. One positive aspect of HELL TO ETERNITY was that it woke up the Marine Corps to Gabaldon's contribution and he was awarded the Navy Cross at El Toro Marine Air Station in 1960. However, any effort to get the Corps to endorse the Congressional Medal of Honor was stymied. Guy Lewis Gabaldon died of a heart attack on August 31, 2006. He was 80. Today, a strong effort is being waged by Congressmen, private business people and friends of Guy to get him the Medal posthumously. It would be measured as a sign of respect, not only to Guy, but to the people in America of Hispanic descent who fought in World War II. ###"

However, what is perhaps even more incredible is the fact that she was a Catholic nun. She was a multi-faceted artist who practiced painting, photography, typography and graphic design, but she became most well known for her colorful serigraphs. In the 1950s, she began teaching art at the Immaculate Heart College in Los Angeles and due to her unorthodox teaching methods, quickly gained an impressive roster of supporters. Creative personalities such as Alfred Hitchcock, Charles and Ray Eames, Buckminster Fuller and John Cage all became a part if Corita's network of friends. In the 1960s, Corita began using popular culture as raw material for her work. Her screen-prints often incorporated product brands of American consumerism alongside spiritual texts. Her work also dealt with the horrors of the Vietnam War, and not surprisingly, this subject matter, coupled with her already controversial teaching techniques did not always sit well with the church. Cardinal McIntyre, the head of the local Los Angeles archdiocese accused her of being, ""A guerilla with a paintbrush."" In 1968, partly as the result of this immense pressure, Corita chose to leave the church. She lived the rest of her life as an artist in private practice on the East Coast. Passion For The Possible will be a documentary film celebrating the life, work, and teachings of this spectacular artist. In honor of what would be Sister Corita's 90th birthday (and in conjunction with an upcoming retrospective at Cal State University Northridge), the film will serve as a living, breathing document of the inspiration she spread to so many people throughout her life. Through the use of interviews with those who knew her as well as others who were influenced by her work, we will tell Corita's story in an abstract way. Using archival images from the Corita archive along with footage shot specifically for this film we will create a colorful visual montage. The film will reveal itself as a living, moving, graphic and musical artwork."

He held up the child, gussied up by her mother in a kroj (the traditional Czech native costume) and bearing a bouquet for the president. Fortunately the attending press photographer, Jano Srámek had the presence of mind to take a picture. From this fortuitous moment an iconic image was born, linking Masaryk's enlightened humanism to a nascent Czechoslovak statehood in a symbolic picture of the elder statesman holding aloft the future of his nation. The photo flew around the world as an immensely popular image, just before the Nazi invasion and just after Masaryk's death. It was later transformed by the gifted Czech engraver Bohumil Heinz into a postage stamp. The great Czech writer and Nobel Prize nominee Karel Kapek pushed for the stamp being used as fund-raiser for needy children and the stamp soon became wildly popular not just among Czechs but throughout the philatelic world. During WW II and the Battle of Britain, exiled Czech airmen had the photograph made into posters to remind them of what they were fighting. To this day, Eva Neugebauerová - now Eva Hanka - receives fan mail from collectors of this stamp, many containing requests for autographs. After the fall of the Berlin Wall the stamp was then re-issued in 2000 by the once-again free and democratic Czech Republic, in celebration of those original Masaryk ideals from the founding of the first republic, and the survival through the ruins of WWI and the nearly three hundred years of foreign rule by Austrian monarchs. Eva, the unwitting child-celebrity of Czech democracy, was forced to emigrate in 1950, while the fledgling Czech democracy was once again being violated by global forces beyond its own control. She was a newlywed and fled with her husband Ladislav Hanka through the Sumava hills and across the Bohemian Wood, in a peregrination through displaced persons camps in Bavaria, postwar UN relief agency employment in Frankfurt, by ship from Bremerhafen and through the port of New York onto the corn fields, Czech communities and land grant colleges of Iowa, eventually settling among the Great Lakes in Kalamazoo. There she raised a family with her microbiologist husband and taught school. With this film she is being visited in her retirement by her great-nephew and film director Jan Rousek who answers the question, ""whatever happened to that cute little girl in the stamp"". The film documents a life story which, like the stamp, does not end with a picture, but becomes an epic journey which is itself emblematic of much that took place in the mid-twentieth century and wrote itself into the hearts of the people, affecting the way we live today."

3869,Bridging the Gap: The Joe Dulin Story (2011),documentary,"""Bridging the Gap"" is the story of a failing educational system and the life of an extremely unique man named Joseph Dulin, who has devoted his life to successfully educating kids whom under normal circumstances, would have fallen through the cracks of the urban educational system. St Martin DePorres Catholic High School was on the verge of bankruptcy after the Riots in 1967, as Dulin took on the unenviable task of transforming the faltering school into an educational success story by using his unique blend of charisma, discipline and unconditional love for his students, who amazingly achieved a 78% College enrollment in a city where the dropout rate is at 79% (in 2006). Outside of traveling for months as a Special Advisor directly to Al Gore during the 2000 election, Dulin has been featured in Time magazine, on The Phil Donahue and highlighted in countless areas of local a national press documenting his fight to educate, and be educated on equal terms, regardless of race or socioeconomic status. As a young man growing up in Evansville Indiana, Dulin stood up to the racism and the resultant anomie that faced most young Black Americans of the 50's and 60's who lived near that line of demarcation known as the Mason-Dixon. But like a prizefighter that uses his brain instead of his fists, Dulin persevered. Whether it was the inequalities of the school system or the institutional racism of the Catholic Church, Dulin never backed down when it came to fighting for equal rights for African Americans during the Civil Rights Movement and beyond. Before starting Roberto Clemente Student Development Center, Dulin applied his fearlessness and convictions to the Detroit Catholic Educational system by transforming St Martin Deporres into a model for not only all Black Catholic High School's, but all Catholic High Schools, irrespective of race. Directors Gary Bredow and Per Franchell followed Principal Dulin over the course of three school years at Roberto Clemente School in Ann Arbor, where Dulin has been the principal for over 30 years. The result is a gripping exploration of the fine line between success and failure of students who live in a world that is punctuated by economic strife and violence. Dulin and his staff run the school more like a family, and deal with issues one student at a time with great detail and concern. Because of the unique practices that are an everyday occurrence at ""Clemente', they have met the challenge with astounding success, despite the proverbial deck that is stacked against the kids and their families. ""Bridging The Gap"" in an unflinching view of the realities of the American Urban educational experience and one man's diligent and successful response in navigating these students over the widening chasm of failure."

This situation is especially difficult for one family consisting solely of three women representing three successive generations. All the males in their family have died in various Afghani wars. The mother had been working as a nurse in a hospital, but regardless of she not being allowed to work, the Taliban has cut off funding to the hospital. The mother and grandmother make what they feel is the only decision they can to survive: they will have the preteen daughter masquerade as a boy so that she can get a job to support the family. The daughter, feeling powerless, agrees despite being scared as if the Taliban discover her masquerade, she is certain they will kill her. Partly as a symbolic measure, the daughter plants a lock of her now cut hair in a pot so that her lost femininity can flourish. The only people outside the family who know of the ruse are the milk vendor who employs the daughter - he who was a friend of her deceased father - and a local boy named Espandi who recognizes her despite her outward change in appearance. Espandi renames her Osama. The masquerade becomes more difficult when the Taliban recruit all the local boys to school, which includes military training. Because of the wars a huge number of women in Afghanistan have lost their husbands, fathers and sons, and have no breadwinners anymore for their families. As the Talibans have imposed very strict regulations for women's clothing and limited their possibilities to move around outdoors, it is almost impossible for women to get paid jobs. On the brink of starvation one widow decides to change her daughter into a boy, by cutting her hair and changing her cloths. A friend of her deceased husband employs the disguised girl in his little snack bar. Some days later the Talibans start recruiting young boys by force to their Koran schools. Also the disguised girl is taken away. Soon the other pupils suspect that she is a girl. A street boy, who knows her true identity, tries to protect her, by assuring that she is a boy with the name Osama, but in vain. The Taliban teachers put her on a torturing test. When blood is dripping down her legs, they know for sure that she is a girl. They take her to a judge, who sentences her to marry old Molla Sahib. He locks her up in his big house in the countryside, together with the wives he already has. A 12-year-old Afghan girl and her mother lose their jobs when the Taliban closes the hospital where they work. The Taliban have also forbidden women to leave their houses without a male ""legal companion."" With her husband and brother dead, killed in battle, there is no one left to support the family. Without being able to leave the house, the mother is left with nowhere to turn. Feeling that she has no other choice, she disguises her daughter as a boy. Now called 'Osama,' the girl embarks on a terrifying and confusing journey as she tries to keep the Taliban from finding out her true identity. Inspired by a true story, Osama is the first entirely Afghan film shot since the fall of the Taliban. In Afghanistan, during the Taliban regime, women are forbidden to work and to walk on the streets without the company of a male. The teenager girl Osama cuts her hair and dresses like a boy to get a job and support her widow mother and grandmother. There is no men in her family, since her father and her brother were killed in previous Afghan wars, and the family has no means of survival.

In big cities discrimination against homosexuality and gay way of life is not a big issue anymore.

In rural areas, however, the definition of what is normal is quite different. Out here, normal means a husband, wife and children ""the nuclear family"". In the country, expressions such as ""proofter"" are still common parlance and mothers are ashamed if their sons fail to bring home a girlfriend.

Concurrently, naysayers, industry funded think-tanks and lobbyists have worked tirelessly to challenge, convolute and dismiss the issue as hysterical. Everything's Cool tells the harrowing story of what it takes to talk about global warming -- the art of duking it out with collective denial, the struggle to communicate the urgency of the crisis to an indifferent public and a laggard United States government. We follow a cadre of messengers who are passionate, exasperated, driven by fear, hope and a deep appreciation for the ever shrinking window of time we have to stop global warming. THE STORY AS IT IS EVOLVING We take to the road with veteran global warming messenger and author Ross Gelbspan, as he launches ""Boling Point"" -- his ""last"" and ""final"" book on the issue. We are behind the scenes at the Weather Channel for the education of Dr. Heidi Cullen, a climatologist cum television personality, who has the unique and often excruciating task of reporting and/explaining climate change in sound-bites fit for a primetime audience. We film a group of citizen-activists -- ages 18 to 80 - training for their inevitable ""elevator speech"" - their chance to tell the right story to the right audience at the right time and rouse the sleeping country. They are the Paul Reveres of the next energy revolution. Meanwhile the national NGOs, who have been working on the crisis of global warming for the past two decades -- including National Resources Defense Council, Greenpeace, Environmental Defense, - along with Moveon.org pin their oft-dashed messaging hopes on a summer Hollywood blockbuster. ""The Day After Tomorrow"" does what they've never been able to do. It fictionalizes every difficult aspect of global warming into a nightmarish, but undeniably compelling message. The impacts are severe and immediate, the rich countries are devastated, the skeptics, the delayers and the recalcitrant feds are taught their lessons, and it all happens in the time-span of a long weekend. For a moment it seems to be working- newspapers have cover stories, news programs devote entire segments to global warming -- the issue is finally in play! Activists, scientists even former VP Al Gore are in almost all the press coverage speaking right on message: ""this might be over the top and science fiction, but global warming is real and happening now."" But our collective attention span is short. Spiderman 2 and Fahrenheit 911 soon push The Day After Tomorrow out of the theaters. The public discourse moves on leaving the issue profile of global warming essentially unchanged and mired near the very bottom of the issue heap coming into the election of 2004. Now what?"

Like the Cosmos and Connections series that inspired it, School Inc. takes viewers on a personal journey, led by an expert so passionate about his field that he made arrangements before his imminent death to ensure the documentary would be completed. Coulson offers his analysis with a sense of circumspection about the limits of science, as well as a sense of humor.

4231,A Blank on the Map (1971),documentary,"At the time this documentary was produced, New Guinea peoples in the highlands in the center of that country had never had contact with Europeans, nor had this part of the interior been mapped from the ground (thus ""blank on the map""). Since aerial maps did exist, Bragge (a government official) and his staff were able to plan their journey, mainly by river and tributary, and then aiming toward areas where trees had been cleared, in the belief that these might represent ""gardens,"" small plots of land on which natives grew food. These maps also allowed planning for an air drop two weeks into the journey. Attenborough, Bragge, and national police assigned to Bragge set off in a party of 101, mostly bearers bringing food, canvas for shelters, and of course the cameras and film, medicines and other supplies needed for the expedition. Some of the staff had to go ahead and break trail for the rest, since after the last leg of the journey that could be made by canoe had been completed, there was no trail from that last Europeanized settlement. It was necessary to go up one mountain and down to the next and over to another river to meet the airdrop. In all this time, the expedition met no natives, although they did encounter a deserted ceremonial house with a warm fireplace. By a mischance, they had not been able to procure an interpreter likely to know the language of the people they sought. All they knew was the name that people called themselves--and of course they weren't sure exactly whom they might encounter. Headhunters had once been known in these areas. Only a few days before their scheduled return, with no sighting of natives, and desperate to achieve their goal of contact, Bragge sent a bearer to stand out in a relatively clear area and repeatedly call the name of the people they had heard lived there. The next morning, a small group of men appeared and efforts began to understand one another. After some preliminary gifts, Bragge suggested trading for native taro and bananas, and the men returned to their unseen village. They came back the following day with trade goods, and the expedition found that items such as glass beads and newspaper, valued by other New Guinea tribes, were not valued by this group, who did accept salt. Finally Bragge suggested that the men show them their homes, at which point suspicion set in. The film appears to show that only three men followed the small group--Bragge, Attenborough, and the cameraman, apparently unarmed, but as the Europeans lagged behind the natives, the latter disappeared noiselessly into the jungle and did not return when the name of their people was called again. Throughout the expedition, Attenborough and the cameraman recorded birds (including a few of one type of bird of paradise), an echidna, leeches, a ""tree kangaroo"" and other wildlife, as well as plants, the daily life of the expedition, and the weather."

4473,Lampedusa (2016),biography,"Two people return to the Mediterranean island of Lampedusa. Giulia overcame a personal crisis here, Zakaria fled here from the civil war in his homeland of Somalia. Schreiner tells about them, about innermost thoughts, existential questions and fears, about transiency: A search for meaning that remains fragmentary, moving between memory and now. The past presses into the monologues and conversations in the present of the cinematic image. It has written itself visibly into the skin, faces, and bodies that Schreiner explores in close ups, which become practically perceptible, yet nonetheless remain highly artificial. The strict, sensual beauty of these images, the play with abstraction of brilliant black-and-white, of light and shadow, the long, calm takes, the concentration on details all create the space for an intuitive, concentrated awareness, a space of encounter. The site of this encounter is concrete, but for the characters, the sparse, brittle landscape of Lampedusa turns into a stage of sorts, and a projection; an abstract space. Just as this island exists as a mere idea for most of us, as a place where political action becomes manifest, and also a crisis-the relationship of old Europe and young Africa, the dynamics of resistance and mesmerized attraction, of inside and outside. Schreiner drafts Lampedusa as a universal, internal narrative, as intense space of experience and association, oscillating between documentary and fictional elements. Freed of the necessity to explain, the film itself becomes a search and interrogation-of the characters, cinematic form, and our own present realities. A woman, a man. The island of Lampedusa, where their escape routes intersect. Zakaria, in his late twenties, from Somalia, who has risked his life coming to the island on a small boat when fleeing civil war in his country. Giulia, in her mid-fifties, a tourist from Northern Italy, on the run from deep personal crises. Both have returned to the island."

4551,Harlan County U.S.A. (1976),documentary,"This film documents the coal miners' strike against the Brookside Mine of the Eastover Mining Company in Harlan County, Kentucky in June, 1973. Eastovers refusal to sign a contract (when the miners joined with the United Mine Workers of America) led to the strike, which lasted more than a year and included violent battles between gun-toting company thugs/scabs and the picketing miners and their supportive women-folk. Director Barbara Kopple puts the strike into perspective by giving us some background on the historical plight of the miners and some history of the UMWA. In the summer 1973, the coal miners working at the Brookside Mine, located in Brookside, Harlan County, Kentucky and owned by the Eastover Coal Company, voted to join the union, United Mine Workers of America (UMWA), against the wishes of Eastover administrators. Shortly thereafter, the miners went out on strike on Eastover and its parent company, Duke Power Company, refusing to sign a contract with its employees, union members. Beyond the direct economic issues of wages and benefits, the miners' grievances included long standing inherent problems with the coal mining industry in the United States in general, such as health issues most specifically with black lung from inhaling coal dust, and other more acute dangers, an explosion at Consolidated Coal's Mannington Mine in Farmington, West Virginia a few years earlier which killed seventy-eight of eighty-two people working in the mine itself at the time. The company was granted an injunction prohibiting the strikers from blocking vehicles from entering/exiting the mine site and from calling the replacement workers hired ""scabs"". Emotions on both sides ramped up as the strike progressed, with wives and other miner supporters joining the strikers on the picket lines, and the potential for violence, most specifically gun violence, becoming more blatant. Discussions of a no-strike clause as a possible item within a contract became the most contentious issue. But other problems within the UMWA, which led to an indictment for murder, and the UMWA's contractual relationship to the Bituminous Coal Operators Association (BCOA) would also be factors. But a tragedy would be the turning point in the divisive strike, which hearkened back to similar such struggles in the area during the great depression. In this documentary about labor tension in the coal-mining industry, director 'Barbara Kopple' (qv) films a strike in rural Kentucky. After the coal miners at the Brookside Mine join a union, the owners refuse the labor contract. Once the miners start to strike, the owners of the mine respond by hiring scabs to fill the jobs of the regular employees. The strike, which lasts more than a year, frequently becomes violent, with guns produced on both sides, and one miner is even killed in a conflict."

4600,Fermeuse (2016),short,"The view to the sea from the most easterly point on the North American continent is infinitely expansive and affords no stability of perception. The horizon there changes quickly, dramatically and so completely that worlds appear and disappear in minutes. Shifting integrity, the long space condenses and thins, retreats and advances, reveals and obscures, materializes and dematerializes, brightens and dulls. Fermeuse is the registration of a magical yet unnerving phenomenon visible from Pouch Cove, Newfoundland - it occurs in a largely untraveled, pristine, harsh and remote landscape. Occasional glimpses and photographs constitute ""attention"", yet fail to communicate the immensity of the drama where the threshold of the axis mundi is suspended. The video is a timepiece that tracks individual moments of time while presenting as a rhythmic whole. It regulates horizontal unpredicability yet does not keep pace with the time it takes the earth to make a complete revolution around the sun, nor the time it takes the earth to complete one rotation on its axis. Fermeuse requires, in making and viewing, an enduring, slow and specific focus that is atypical in a society prone to split attention, simultaneous activity, instant connectivity and multiple distractions."

He places his face in the center of the vertical screen. He bars it from the viewer by the horizontal intermingling bands. The stripes move like sliding doors creating an illusion of dual reality. The artist concentrates on a human ability to live two realms - physical and spiritual - at one time. In his book Theater and its Double, Antonin Artaud advocated for a unique language made up between thought and action. Tim White-Sobieski develops the visual language between his juxtaposed personalities to interpret differences between action and thought. Main theme of Desire departs from erotic fantasy. The artist pictures himself as a two-faced Janus - capable of both innocence and harm. His face is shown shattered into many pieces - ""circles of desire"". The artist created perforated fragments of body parts that overlap in his imagination. These ""confetti"" multiply and grow until they cover his face completely. Eroticism serves as a further environment in which White-Sobieski examines his identity. He divides his face on the screen in two halves that co-exist in different emotional mediums. Like Shakespearean Iago, the artist says: ""I am not what I am"". This reference to duality signifies his deceptiveness, but also marks him as an observer of his own behavior. Dual personality is usually a person who has dramatically alternating type of behavior, thoughts, and feelings. These personalities often are direct opposites and dominate at different times. These types of individuals strive to solve their identity crisis. They actually have a great struggle maintaining the integrity of a single self."

As settlers moved in from the east, they brought with them their own way of life that would alter the manner in which the American Indians had lived for a thousand or more years. Likewise they documented the mountain men which was a short lived era, approximately 20 years. Artist George Catlin, Alfred Jacob Miller and others of this era knew that the way of life for the American Indian would rapidly change with the influence of white settlers.

That complication is on top of the difficulty of especially Shirley only hearing and seeing what she wants to believe, which in this situation is coming to terms with Nelson being in love with a shiksa who takes her clothes off in public. When Nelson is finally able to tell his parents the truth, Martin and Shirley, who have their own individual and slightly different preconceived notions concerning everything around homosexuality, have to come to terms with the news, which is difficult. That difficulty includes how they believe their friends and relatives will take the news, such as Martin's hyper-masculine employer, his Uncle Moisha, and Shirley's brother and sister-in-law, Max and Sophie.

Young Sophie and her brother grew up in a household run by vaudevillian actors who tended to believe that all problems could be remedied by a tangerine or a bowl of consecrated chicken soup.

Meanwhile local children decided to capitalize on the history of this region and started showing tourists around Prussian monuments. During such tour one can see: a squalid 18th c. palace of the Stauffenberg family, a pyramid shaped tomb build in 1811 by Wilhelm Von Farenheid and a 19th c. sepulchral chapel of the Steigert family. These monuments bearing witness to their owners' former glory are barely mentioned in official guide books, therefore children download any information possible from the Internet. Their knowledge by far exceeds school curricula. A tourist can hire such a tourist guide or simply buy a leaflet from such a child. You pay at your own discretion. Sometimes it is 1EUR, sometimes a simple ""thank you"". Some young tour guides speak German. They get generous tips from German groups. To these children this is the only way to earn money for books and school equipment. Some children contribute to household budgets. Their parents look kindly at their children's business, with a hint of jealousy though. It would not be appropriate for them to be tourist guides like their children."

4871,"""Trivia Trap"" (1984)",game-show,"Short-lived game show which used two formats and implemented the use of celebrities in an attempt to cash in on the trivia game craze. Two three-member teams -- the ""Juniors"" (whose members were younger than 30 years old) and the ""Seniors"" (contestants were older than 30 years old); one of them was the returning champions -- competed. Early in the show's run, host Eubanks announced two sets of four possible answers to a trivia question; the captain of the challenging team selected one set, to which Eubanks read the question. In turn, each team member had to eliminate the three incorrect answers, leaving just the right answer. Eliminating all three wrong answers was worth $300 to the team, but finding the right answer ended play on that question (though each wrong answer eliminated was worth $50). Each team played two such questions, with a new set of answers replaced the old one. After each team played two questions, the contestants competed in the ""$1,000 Trivia Race,"" or simply a round of standard general knowledge questions. A member of the team in control selected a category (from a choice of three), to which Eubanks read a question. If that player was incorrect, his/her teammates were given a chance to answer, but if all three were wrong, control passed to the other team. The first 10 questions were worth $100 each, with all remaining questions earning $200. The first team to $1,000 won the game and moved on to the ""Trivia Ladder"" bonus round. In this two-stage round, the three players line up according to how well they performed in the Trivia Race. The first-seeded player is shown four possible answers and decides whether to play the question or pass it to the second-seeded player (who is also given the choice); the third-seeded player must play the question if given to him/her. A correct answer at this point earns that player $1,000 and the right to compete for the $10,000 grand prize, though a wrong answer eliminated him/her from the rest of the round. If any players are left, one final set of four answers is shown, for which the players secretly lock in their answer. The contestant(s) who are correct, if any, win or split $10,000. Midway through the run, a new first round called ""Fact or Fiction"" was played in two stages: 1. Each team member answers a true-false question worth $25 each; 2. Each team secretly tries to agree on the right answer to a true-false answer; the team won $50 for each contestant who was correct or $200 if all three were right. Both stages were played twice, and the ""$1,000 Trivia Race"" and ""Trivia Ladder"" continued as before. Near the end of the run, teams of celebrities played the game for charity. All non-celebrity teams played for a maximum of five days, with a theorhetical maximum of $60,750 possible. Two teams of three players competed in this quiz show; the Seniors (aged 30 and up) and the Juniors (under the age of 30). Early in the run, there were two rounds...in round 1, they try to get rid of three wrong answers before finding the right answer; round 2 was the $1,000 Race, where they try to reach or pass $1,000 by answering questions in specific categories. Midway through the run, there were three rounds...round 1 was Fact or Fiction, where they try to answer true-or-false statements from red or black envelopes; round 2 was where the teams agreeing or disagreeing with the selection of their answer from four choices; and round 3 was the $1,000 Race, where the same rules apply. The team that reaches or passes $1,000 wins the game and advances to the $10,000 Trivia Ladder endgame, where the winning team was ranked on how well they did in the $1,000 Race. If a player answers correctly, he/she wins $1,000 and has a chance at $10,000 at the top of the ladder. If he/she answers wrong, then he/she is eliminated. The player(s) who made it to the top of the ladder now try to either answer orally (if only one player remained) or secretly lock in what they think is the right answer (if two or all three players remained). If only one player answered correctly, then he/she wins $10,000. If two or all three players answered correctly, then they split $10,000. A team can stay up to five games; after that they retire undefeated."

4973,Pills Profits Protest (2005),documentary,"""Pills Profits Protest"" is an up-to-the minute documentary about global AIDS treatment activism. It examines the national and international grass roots response to an epidemic that has already overshadowed the Black Death in terms of human lives lost. The demand for access to affordable treatment for 40 million people living with HIV, most of whom live in poor countries, represents one of the most successful political movements of contemporary history. This documentary examines critical junctures in the battle for access to HIV treatment as the poorest and most marginalized individuals confront larger powers, including governments, corporate bodies and a multinational drug industry that is motivated by profit. The fight for AIDS drugs is taking place in tandem with a growing anti-globalization movement; the latter provides a backdrop for examining AIDS through a lens of poverty, socioeconomic injustice and human rights. At the heart of this documentary is a thorny question: Can the world afford universal HIV treatment? At what cost? What will be the global cost if we fail to treat and save 40 million people now? Pills, Profits and Protest are the three thematic touchstones of our film, each reflecting an important aspect of the current battle. Behind this movement are people, personalities and lives. Our film weaves their personal stories with a larger chronicle of history-in-the-making."
4974,"""TV Tonga News"" (2000)",news,"Produced by the government-owned Tonga Broadcasting Commission, TV Tonga News is the chief provider of news and information for television viewers in the tiny South Pacific island kingdom. Currently reaching almost three quarters of the nation's 100,000-strong population, this program -- broadcast five nights a week in both English and Tongan -- highlights the daily major events throughout Tonga and the South Pacific, blending a mix of local, regional, and international news. But beneath all the hype, TV Tonga News is just another sad example of how press freedom in Tonga has rapidly degenerated to all new levels of subjugation and autocracy. Laws allowing changes to the country's constitution have been passed by Cabinet, making it now illegal for Tongan media to publish or broadcast anything even remotely critical of their own government. Overseas news stories investigating the questionable activities of high profile Tongan leaders & ministers are regularly cut and prevented from making the local airwaves. In between the countless fluff news pieces that are covered ad nauseam on any given night -- from check presentations of aid money, to the never-ending string of seminars and three day workshops -- one cannot help but notice the lack of genuinely newsworthy items on this program. The reporters often leave the real stories to go untold, fearing government reprisal and possible imprisonment. Some might say the people of Tonga would be better pressed to find out the real news from their local hairdresser or kava circle, than from watching this extremely one-sided, predisposed propaganda."

Unable to resist the seething political atmosphere back home, she embarks French husband, Hervé Cohen (co-director) and their two sons 15 year-old Yeelen and Joakim 11, on a journey to bear witness to the historical grassroots movement that is uniting Americans across party and racial lines. And so, what began as a video diary of the political coming of age of their sons, would later turn into an electoral road movie across the country in the quest of rediscovering America and redefining oneself in it. For weeks on, as the mainstream media, political pundits spend airtime dissecting and fragmenting the American electorate, the couple journey across the country unearthing the compelling stories of an array of charismatic individuals, turning their lenses to a mosaic of American faces and lives: Congresswoman, lawyer, public defender, nurse, street musician, spoken word poet, punk rockers, environmentalist, rabbi, gay activists and a mellifluous flow of other individuals breathe life into the film. From Houston, Texas to Chapel Hill, North Carolina and from Roseburg, Oregon, to Boca Raton, Florida, via the Southside of Chicago, Illinois, we see Republicans and Democrats coming together to rethink and redefine democracy in America.

By the end of the film, the couple discovers an answer to their question: Shall we return to America and engage in the changes to come?
