Rittenberg becomes directly involved in these secret overtures. He dreams of becoming a bridge between America a new China. But nobody in Washington is really listening. In scenes with General Marshall and President Truman we see how America stumbled yet again into a disastrous foreign policy blunder. Rittenberg treks north, to Mao's base in Yan'an. He meets Mao. Mao gives him a job. He also hooks up again with Yulin. They fall in love. They marry. Civil War erupts. Rittenberg and Yulin are with Mao as he inflicts defeat after defeat on Chiang's forces. America has backed the wrong horse. As Mao's army claims victory and the Generalissimo flees the country, Rittenberg's dream is still alive. He is ordered to Beijing. He believes that this is his moment. It's a cruel deception. After America had ignored Mao's overtures, the Chinese saw no choice but to renew their old alliance with the Russians. On orders from Moscow, Rittenberg is arrested as an American spy. He experiences for himself the dark and deadly side of the movement to which he has pledged his full allegiance: the nightmare of the Chinese Communist penal system. On Stalin's death, in 1953, Rittenberg is released. He stays in China. He stays with Yulin. All this is true. It is historical fact. And Sidney Rittenberg is still going strong, at 93 - a living witness to the revolution that changed the world and that we see, in this movie, for the first time, from a completely fresh perspective.

70 ::: Tim Minchin: So Live (2007) ::: Tim Minchin's live concert captured for this DVD, performed at the Sydney Opera House, in one of the smaller Studio Theatre rooms. This is an intimate show and the vibe within the venue is a little proper, but they do seem to enjoy themselves. Tim's act is a compilation of pieces from his successful stage shows Dark Side and So Rock, combining spoken stand-up routines with hilariously witty musical numbers on the piano - an instrument on which Tim is clearly more than adept. To my mind, Tim's comedic forte combines the 'rock' aspirations of Tenacious D with the supreme wit and cabaret-style musical flair of Neil Innes' Bonzo Dog Band. He's a fantastic musician, an intelligent, thought-provoking lyricist and a side-splittingly hilarious showman.

138 ::: Winter's Watch (2017) ::: Located ten miles off the coast of mainland New England, the Oceanic Hotel is the grand, yet far-from-modern home to the thousands of guests who brave the choppy seas to visit during the warmer spring and summer months. Off-season, the hotel and the 43-acre Star Island on which it sits is home to one woman - its winter caretaker who braves the colder, darker months of inclement weather by embracing the solitude and finding inspiration, and life, in what would otherwise be considered the 'bones' of winter. Intrepid photographer Alexandra de Steiguer embraces five cold months of solitude year after year on a remote island group miles off the coast of Maine in her role as winter caretaker. Since 1997, Star Island in the Isles of Shoals has had this lone winter resident sharing a very small world with only the seals, seabirds, twenty-nine historic buildings, and a landscape so spare and forbidding that the viewer finds it difficult to believe that nearly twenty years of inspiration could come from such a place. Director Brian Bolster's beautifully filmed documentary echoes - quietly but gorgeously - the still-frame photography of his subject, but also shows us how her richly inspired outlook - looking out from the shores of this small island - has caused her to also look inward in ways most people only aspire to. Philosophical, contemplative, engaging, beautiful and engaging, this short film fits informally into a trilogy of sorts created by Brian Bolster as he shares the lives of people working for extended periods in isolated environments, who have - in their solitude - become not only deeply connected to their "place", but who have somehow deepened their connection to the wider world as well.

165 ::: Busted: The Citizen's Guide to Surviving Police Encounters (2004) ::: Most people don't know their basic constitutional rights, and those who do usually waive them in the face of police intimidation. Worse, police rely on people's fear and ignorance of the law to trick them into waiving their rights, which often lands them in jail. That's why Flex Your Rights (FyR) -- a Washington, DC-based educational group -- created BUSTED: The Citizen's Guide to Surviving Police Encounters. This fun 45-minute educational DVD realistically depicts three common police scenarios -- traffic stop, street stop, and home entry. Narrator Ira Glasser, a former ACLU executive director, shows you how to avoid cops' "gotcha games" as they try to trick you into waiving your rights; how to be courteous but not intimidated by police tactics; and how phrases such as "I don't consent to any searches" can keep you out of jail. According to Steve Silverman, BUSTED's writer and FyR's executive director, "We made BUSTED for anyone who's afraid that their looks or lifestyle makes them a target for law enforcement. This includes skaters, smokers, rockers, and freedom-loving badasses of all sorts."
166 ::: The Passion of the Mao (2006) ::: Who knew that Communism could be so funny? This madcap documentary reexamines the Cultural Revolution and restores the once bright reputation of Mao Zedong. "The Passion of the Mao" begins by correcting misconceptions about Mao's early years. Unlike the tyrants with whom he is usually compared, Mao was a successful scholar and businessman before he became a rabble-rouser. By the mid1950s, he had unified China, spurred an impressive rate of growth, restructured the education system, and improved living standards. Then he became a Maoist. Mao devoted the rest of his life to eliminating the centralized Soviet bureaucracy he and his colleagues had built. The film takes viewers back to the 1960s. Successful women and men, some now professors at major universities in the West, credit Mao and especially the Cultural Revolution for making them feminists and allowing them access to education. During the Cultural Revolution, Mao brought Western-style ballets and operas, reinterpreted in Chinese form, to China's villages. Peasants chose leaders who represented their true interests, and rural communities built schools independent of the central government. And what about the anti-Maoist beliefs that have sullied the reputation of the man once referred to as "the sun in the sky?" They are part of a vast radical conspiracy, the result of propaganda churned out by the same people who turned the tanks on the Tiananmen demonstrators.

Dohler has also inspired artists and filmmakers such as Robert Crumb (Fritz the Cat), J.J. Abrams (Creator of TV show Lost ) and Art Speigelman ( Maus ) with his underground comix character ProJunior, and his DIY filmmaking magazine, Cinemagic. Mild-mannered and unassuming, Dohler started making wholesome sci-fi films in the Baltimore area in 1976, but recently began including nudity and gore in his movies to please distributors. At age 59 he's just finished his most gratuitous movie to date and it's selling well, yet Dohler feels "sick of the exploitative stuff" and is considering giving up the Blood, Boobs and Beast formula. However, Dohler's recent partner Joe Ripple disagrees and views these components as essential to gaining distribution.

It went viral with over 15 million hits, and instantly launched her as the poster child against privileged young white women volunteering overseas.

Among them are untrained medical volunteers, eager for experience, who tackle procedures beyond their training or ability, potentially putting a patient's life at risk.

In later years Dr. Grant Hunter falls in love with Dot and she persuades him to give up his work in vivisection. "Dot" loves Grant, but his suit is frowned upon by Sarah Wentworth.

409 ::: Loops (1973) ::: In the Summer of 1972 I agreed to direct and act in several porno loops. I contacted William Markle, a local New York Cinematographer, and asked him if he had an interest in creating a documentary, in partnership with me, about a day in the life of a pornographer. He jumped at the chance. In 1972 porno was all the rage, and we thought that a documentary, or docudrama about the making of XXX rated films might just be successful at the box office. The actors who participated in the shooting of the loops were: Myself, Harry Reems, Fred Lincoln, Lucy Grantham, Sargeant Tina, and several Gypsies. The footage turned out to be hilarious, but it needed another element in order to hold an audience's interest for feature length. I wrote a story about a film maker, who was making porno on the side, unbeknownst to Mrs. Film maker. We Hired an actress/belly dancer named Cathy Joyce to play my wife, and shot the script I had written. We intercut the new dramatized scenes of the film maker and his wife with the original documentary footage of the making of porno loops, and the result was a feature length docudrama, or docucomedy called "LOOPS". In the Fall of 1972 Bill Markle and I began the process of screening our project for potential distributors. Everybody saw it; MGM, Avco Embassy, Columbia, Paramount, Warners. Heady times for a couple of young film makers. In the end none of the majors had the guts to pull the trigger on this kind of project. We came close with Warners, but they finally decided against it. During one of the screenings, Sean Cunningham (Last House On the Left, Friday the Thirteenth)began weeping. He saw "LOOPS" as the story of his life, right down to having the same first name as the main character. (Me) So Bill and I sold the picture to Cunningham. The sale figure didn't exactly break the bank, but it was way more than it cost to make so Bill and I were Happy. After some re-shooting and re-editing, Cunningham opened "LOOPS" to mixed reviews and pretty negative box office. This movie seems to have completely disappeared from the face of the earth. In the mid Seventies "LOOPS" was in the archives of the Lincoln Center Film Society, but since then has fallen through the cracks. Cunningham may, or may not still own the rights to this picture, but to my knowledge, no attempt has been made to release "LOOPS" in video or dvd.

612 ::: "Trigger Flaws" (2016) ::: A quintessential California unicorn princess warrior-goddess and her friends meticulously navigate their paths to becoming one with their spiritual selves and even when they are in true mindfulness, sometimes their humanity still gets in the way. The show follows Egypt, a contemporary chic Southern Californian whose relentless search for spiritual and mental enlightenment never ends. With the help of her friends, all of whom can read each other's thoughts (also accompanied by her Shaman, Harry Paul only visible to her), she approaches her goal of perfecting her higher-self with all the vigor one might expect from an artist in the uber-liberal landscape of modern day Los Angeles. However, due to her most human qualities, and comedic sensibilities that invoke the essence of Lucille Ball and Carol Burnett type silliness, she sometimes falls short of the perfection that she seeks. And while these failings to attain true oneness and synchronicity with the universe probably make her more complete as an individual and the higher being that she aspires to be, she'll never stop trying to have all of her spiritual ducks in a neat little row. Of course this will never happen, but that is precisely the journey that the audience can laugh at and relate to. Another aspect of Egypt's world, is her love and respect of culture and fashion. Both of which are manifestations of her love for life and her unending quest for beauty in the world, and this becomes abundantly clear when we get to know the people that surround her. Holly, her best friend and co-conspirator in all things ethereal, shares this keen sense of art and fashion which often becomes apparent in their "shared" thoughts and jokes. All of her female friends participate in this shared-mind convention that drives the comedy of the show, but Holly's thoughts are most closely related to Egypt's and their similar sensibilities and goals reinforce that throughout the show. Then there's Harvey, a talented musician, and Egypt's best guy friend, who is only more evidence of her love for the arts. It's a purely platonic relationship, and even though it's pretty clear he envisions it as something more, she's very careful to not blur the lines. However, that doesn't mean their situation doesn't pop up every now and then in his or her female friends' thoughts and cause awkward moments. All of these elements and more add up to an easy-going, upbeat, new-age, positive energy comedy that not only inspires the viewer, but reminds them that although one may be best served by employing the methods and practices of meditation, and living a healthy metaphysical lifestyle, there's still plenty of room to not take ourselves too seriously, and to lean on our friends when the world doesn't make complete sense.

The variations are a consequence of experience, which transforms the object and makes us continually invest it with new meanings. This sense of constant change happens during the course of the film just as surely as it happens to us in our daily lives. Through spoken text, popular music and images from the streets of New York, Rules of the Road takes a somewhat whimsical, somewhat caustic look at how our dreams of freedom, pleasure, security, and family are so often symbolized by the automobile.

817 ::: Broder Gabrielsen (1966) ::: "Broder Gabrielsen" vekket i sin tid meget stor debatt, og allerede under innspillingen av filmen gikk b≈ôlgene h≈ôyt i pressen. Filmen retter en sterk advarsel mot religi≈ôs fanatisme og mot samtidens vekkeslsespredikanter, og den m≈ôtte da ogsƒ∫ sterk motb≈ôr fra enkelte av disse. I filmen m≈ôter vi den noksƒ∫ ubetydelige legpredikanten, Broder Gabrielsen (Alf Malland), som oppdager hvordan moderne musikk, rytmer og ekstase gir stor suksess nƒ∫r det gjelder ƒ∫ fƒ∫ tilh≈ôrerne til sin forkynnelse. Han fƒ∫r snart sitt store gjennombrudd, og holder ekstatiske vekkelsesm≈ôter med tungetale og "helbredelser" ved hjelp av b≈ônn. Det ender i mismot og nederlag da undrene uteblir for Gabrielsen, og personlig tragedier for de som har latt seg lede.
818 ::: Appels Crois√©s (2018) ::: With its massive immigrant population, Switzerland has always been a place of a double search: first, how is the country's DNA evolving as it constantly redefines itself? Second, how do these foreigners articulate their search for identity in the midst of uncertainty and constant need to define the "self" in tangible terms? The country's position on the issue of immigration and its impacts on society comes with a search within one of its largest one: the Albanian population. How can one's definition of the 'self' encompass all layers associated to identity? And how does this universal search apply to each country's standards?

822 ::: Return to Byzantium: The Art and Life of Lilian Broca (2012) ::: Return to Byzantium is the story of a homecoming - an artistic and physical return to a Romania which Lilian's family was forced to flee more than half a century ago but which she never abandoned. Lilian Broca first became aware of her artistic nature while a young girl growing up in Romania during the 1950's. At the age of 7 her parents enrolled her in art classes. However, the country's communist regime didn't encourage imagination or self-expression and her introduction to drawing and painting was limited. She recalls the day that the drab, grey world of Soviet-shadowed Bucharest was suddenly illuminated by her first glimpse of real art: a brilliant Byzantine icon illuminated by a shaft of golden sunlight in the neighbourhood church. For the first time in her life, Broca was captivated by the radiant splendour of an image. Even without any religious reference, the icon's beauty held her in its thrall. In the words of eminent Romanian art critic Pavel Susara, "...Lilian Broca does not regard herself as an artist locked in her studio, but as someone who tries to resolve a fundamental problem, someone who tries to find her roots, rebuild her intrinsic coherence and regain her identity." Lilian Broca combines a variety of cultural, religious and artistic traditions - Romanian orthodox, Hebrew, Western and North American, thus becoming a symbolic focal point of artistic and inter-civilisational dialogue in our contemporary globalised cultural landscape.

825 ::: The Wedding Video (2003) ::: You're invited to the wackiest wedding since Robert Altman last threw the rice, where no one is polite and everyone "acts" real. What is truth, and what is fiction? How does one discern reality from pretense? These are serious questions, but if you're looking for answers ≈ï la Japanese abstraction, German expressionism or Swedish nihilism, keep looking, because The Wedding Video has the answer, "REAL WORLD" style. In the first film to come out of the MTV phenomenon, Norman Korpi (the gay guy from "Real World-New York") and creative partner Clint Cowen have made a deliciously wicked satire that skewers all the clich√©s and conventions of the reality show. Norm plays "Norm" who hires "Clint" to film his gay wedding. He invites his best friends - all popular "Real World" alums - and has Clint tape them as they arrive for the bachelor party and ceremony. The cast members have great fun parodying the on-air personas that MTV created for them through its editing: San Francisco's Rachel is now the ultimate self-centered bitch, London's Lars has his nose stuck up so high he might die from asphyxiation, and New York's Heather B. becomes a walking-talking hip-hop video. And in the "true" manner of such shows, every backstab, every catfight, and every shocking revelation is caught on videotape for our tawdry entertainment. As the reality genre pushes the envelope - and strains credibility - it becomes ripe for parody; who better to do it than the people who created it in the first place?

830 ::: The Global Village Project (2011) ::: The Global Village School (GVS) in Atlanta GA is a small nonprofit organization with a mission to '...provide adolescent survivors of war, whose formal education has been significantly interrupted by war and prolonged stays in refugee camps, with the enhanced educational and social services they need to become fully participating citizens in the democratic process of the United States'. The school opened in August 2008 and currently provides a unique education to 30 girls from around the globe, aged 13 yrs - 23yrs. It is a haven for these displaced young women from Iraq, Iran, Afghanistan, Somalia, Kenya, Rwanda, Sudan, Zimbabwe, Burma and Thailand, who have recently entered the US, through the United States Refugee Relocation Program. The multi-cultural environment of GVS offers an alternative to the larger public schools, in which most refugee children are usually placed on arrival to the US, in which they get lost within the system, and will never achieve their full potential. This documentary film, narrated by Matthew Lillard, will be shown on a national and international level to increase understanding of the refugee community and, at the same time, contribute to the sustainability of the school. The film will focus on two specific areas: 1. The community and history of the girls, their unique stories of the homes they were forced to leave, their journeys to the US and their future in the next generation of fully participating US citizens. 2. Raise awareness within the US that these children are not just beyond our borders, but new US citizens who will help build our country's future. We hope that, by working together to create this unique film, the young women of the Global Village School will be a voice for the 35,000 refugee children that are relocated to the US every year.

Without knowledge of law, resources, and assistance, we will never know, and remain trapped in the cycle of pain that results, enveloped by ANGER, which then explodes into sheer unchecked VIOLENCE. Violence by a person again their intimate partner is often done as a way for controlling their partner, even if the violence is not the most frequent, and not expected. DOMESTIC VIOLENCE affects us all. Although we are often unaware that it does. No person, family, community or nation is immune to this devastating disease that plagues those affected deeply.

In San Francisco, a decapitated dead body is brought to the morgue, the victim who died in a car accident. The victim is purported to be socialite Jefferson Monk. The story several days earlier. Monk, by chance, meets renowned detective partners Jack Packard and Doc Long at a Russian dance/dinner club. Monk, who is accompanied at the club by a woman only identifying herself as Miss Jean, a woman Monk purportedly does not know and just inserted herself into his evening without invitation, informs the detective pair that someone is trying to kill him, he believing it the unknown man with a peg leg and carrying a small black bag who has been following him. One year ago, Monk was contacted by a mystic named Mr. G, a philosopher with a sacred order, who seemed to be peripherally related to a trip to the Far East that Monk and his loving wife Ellen Monk made. G's primary purpose for contacting Monk was to make him an offer: to purchase his head for $10,000 after he dies due to his resemblance to the order's founder, a man who died one thousand years ago but whose dead body, which Monk saw and does admit looks like him, has been kept eternally young. G believes that Monk may be the reincarnation of the founder. G prophesied that unless Monk accepted the offer, he and Ellen would not survive the night. Further prophesies by G were that Ellen would become an invalid - which has come true, Ellen now confined to a wheelchair - and that Monk would die exactly one year to the date of their meeting, that date approaching within days. Monk believes the peg leg's bag is ultimately for his head. Since that meeting with G, Monk has slowly descended into a near state of madness due to the anxiety. Packard and Long take the case, agreeing to protect Monk and find out who is trying to kill him. With a couple of mysterious deaths associated with the case in the intervening time and with Packard and Long able to discover the truth behind some of the evidence Monk provides to them, is the dead man in the morgue truly Monk, or is there something bigger at play?

1240 ::: Voices Beyond the Wall: Twelve Love Poems from the Murder Capital of the World (2017) ::: In the winter of 2012, Spencer Reece, an award winning American poet and Episcopal priest, came to live at Honduras' only girls' orphanage for a year. On a Fulbright grant to teach the girls poetry and help them create a book of their own work, he found himself immersed in a profoundly challenging environment. His attempts to teach the girls were largely rebuffed- poetry is too difficult, personal, and boring they insist. At the end of Spencer's year, a book of the girls' poems has taken shape and he returns to the United States to edit and publish it.

Always a central back-drop is the frightening world that awaits them outside the thick steel gate. This film, like the poems within it, opens a door to an intimate universe. Voices will be heard, clearly and at long last, by a country that had no place for them and a world that, until now, has turned a deaf ear. For in the histories and hearts of these girls resonate quandaries that have drawn poets for millennia and are no less vital today. And in their emerging voices and lives there is something else revealed: a hope and a challenge; that the world might be home to us all.

But amid the progress, The Mormon Church, with its front-group THE NATIONAL ORGANIZATION FOR MARRIAGE, has been coordinating, financing and leading the effort to stop the advancement of marriage equality for more than three decades. As an organization worth hundreds of billions of dollars, the Mormon Church has been able to wage this war in secret. Not until the California Fair Political Practices Commission launched an investigation into the Mormon's involvement in Proposition 8, did the secrets of the Mormon effort become a matter of record. Through never-before seen documents, recordings & insider-interviews, 8: THE MORMON PROPOSITION, exposes the efforts of the Mormon Church and its members to halt nearly every piece of LGBT legislation on the desks of lawmakers from Hawaii to New York. 8: THE MORMON PROPOSITION makes these efforts a matter of record and challenges viewers to demand more of government officials in requiring religions more transparency in their efforts to influence public policy. Emmy-award winning journalist and documentary filmmaker Reed Cowan is a former Mormon who served a two-year mission door-to-door for the Mormon Church. His access to high-level Mormons & Mormon communications on the matter, coupled with his OUT status as a gay man and father of two adopted sons has provided a compelling and at times shocking look at the Mormon way of doing business against LGBT people.

She continued to write eventually producing 86 novels with an estimated 2 billion copies in print. In December 1926, best-selling mystery writer Agatha Christie suddenly vanishes, leaving her husband Archie with no clue as to her whereabouts.

1331 ::: The Deepest Truth of Human Existence (2002) ::: Beside the Ganga River in Rishikesh, India, Eckhart Tolle talks about the deepest truth in human existence.

But they are not the truth, which is why Tolle asks us to listen to the gaps in his words as well as to the words themselves. Do we know ourselves? Some of us think we do. But what we really mean, says Tolle, is "I know a lot about myself." We know facts, information; we know the contents of our minds. But that does not mean we know ourselves. Tolle's meditation on the truth brings up the subjects of psychoanalysis, celebrity, the ego, the symbol of the Christian cross, overeating and other things. But no things are his true subject. Nothing is. The truth is not in the words, but the gaps between them.

He leaves his Armenian wife and daughter in the care of Abu, a servant. An uprising among the Turks ensues and Mrs. Fitzgerald and the child are taken captive.

Fitzgerald goes to Mecca to avoid capture, and hides the prayer book in a recess in the wall. Several years pass. Jack Stanton hears Lord Fitzgerald exclaim that it is impossible for any white man to emulate the feat that he did years ago. Stanton claims that if an Englishman could enter Mecca, an American could to it too. A bet is made whereby Stanton is to go to Mecca and, unaided, bring back the prayer book hidden by Fitzgerald. Stanton arrives at Mecca, disguised as a pilgrim. His father was the American Consul at Damascus in Stanton's youth, and his knowledge of Arabic is good. He finds the prayer book, but an Arab named Sadi steals it during the night. Stanton follows Sadi to Damascus.

The marriage takes place in spite of Faimeh's protestations. Amad utters the triple Moslem sentence of divorce, and she is again free.

Amad and El Sabbagh find Sadi, who tells them about Stanton and the girl. They start in pursuit, and during a sandstorm Amad is separated from his companions. Stanton has taken refuge behind his camel and Amad stumbles upon him and crawls under the same blanket that is protecting Stanton. The storm abates. Amad tries to kill Stanton, who finally gets the upper hand, and when he has Amad in his power his pity for the older man grows and he finally compels him to get on his camel, divides the water and tells him to be on his way before he changes his mind. In Damascus, Fitzgerald, through the jewels Faimeh wears, discovers that she is his daughter. Faimeh and Fitzgerald search for Stanton and meet Amad, who tells them about his self-sacrifice. Days later a sun-blistered man, almost out of his mind, staggers into Fitzgerald's apartment. There he sees Fitzgerald and Faimeh in an attitude of endearment and taking a mistaken idea from it, utters the triple divorce and then falls in a faint.

Eventually we discover that this death experience was a dream, which greatly unsettled Vito, precipitating him to seek the truth relative to life's purpose, and the afterlife. Vto has periods of contemplation and dialogue with the housekeeper, barber, gardener, and his wife in search of answers - Is there such a place as heaven? Does Hell exist? Am I a good person? etc. Vito's soul searching includes a flashback to his youth listening to his grandfather speaking to him about eternity. In the midst of this quest for truth, as Vito is driving down the driveway about to exit the front gate, it occurs to him that his day is repeating itself as in the dream. Certain events of the morning...such as him making a demeaning comment to Mike, who is washing Vito's Porsche, were precisely as they were in the dream - "his dream was becoming his realty." Frightened that if he continued to go through the gate he would, like the dream, have a fatal heart attack, and be condemned to eternal death. Frantically he returns to his house, prays and has an edifying flashback to his youth, in which death, which is currently crippling with fear, is being discussed. In a state of angst he calls for his friend, Father Dellos, asking him to come to his home. Upon arrival the the priest counsels him about the events of this "strange" morning, and hears his confession. Finally, Vito makes a third and final journey down the driveway.

1346 ::: SiDiKi (2014) ::: Running on the dusty roads of Guinea at the age of fourteen, Sidiki's legs stop working. He falls down- mysteriously paralyzed. Polio or bad spirits, nobody cures him. He falls again, but this time into a deep depression. In Guinea, as in most other cultures, there are prejudices and preconceived notions of those who are different; they blind us to the abilities that lie within. Unwilling to accept this fate, Sidiki literally takes matters into his own hands, and in the village where he was discarded he teaches himself how to dance without legs. Participating in the rite-of-passage ceremony of his village (to dance the traditional steps for continuous hours) Sidiki becomes a man, changing the way his people view those labeled as disabled. A grown man, Sidiki Conde is now revered in his native country as a master of music and dance, and his life's work is to empower people all over the world to accept their own abilities and feel free to dance as they are. This feature-length documentary SiDiKi takes the audience on a journey from Sidiki's current home in New York City's East Village to the Guinean village of Mancellia that awakened his spirit through dance. The journey is dotted with multiple stops in small towns and villages that welcome Sidiki. Those with disabilities come out of hiding and flock to Sidiki's message of hope. Paralleling this journey is the transformation of students from the Brookville Center for Children's Services who are learning to cope with their own disabilities by finding their inner rhythm through dancing in one of Sidiki's week-long workshops. They struggle to see beyond their limitations, but over time, they are strengthened by the power of self-acceptance and freedom of movement. SiDiKi is shot with a sensitive cinema v√©rit√© lens with music original to Sidiki and his band highlighted throughout. Notably, one of the goals of the film is to raise awareness of the powerful affect dance and the arts have on the human spirit. At the same time, SiDiKi illuminates the plight of the disabled in Guinea and around the world, it speaks to the universal themes of perseverance and triumph. SiDiKi challenges societies' preconceptions on disabilities and stimulates the audience to find their own courageous rhythm; it confronts our intolerance toward those who are atypical, opening our eyes to the truth that ability is born from within, not from body, and that we each move to a beat of our own.

1413 ::: The Least of These (2009) ::: THE LEAST OF THESE explores one of the most controversial aspects of American immigration policy: family detention. As part of the Bush administration policy to end what they termed the "catch and release" of undocumented immigrants, the U.S. government opened the T. Don Hutto Residential Center in May 2006 as a prototype family detention facility. The facility is a former medium-security prison in central Texas operated by CCA, the largest private prison operator in the country. The facility houses immigrant children and their parents from all over the world who are awaiting asylum hearings or deportation proceedings. The facility was initially activated with little media attention or public knowledge. Soon, however, immigration attorney Barbara Hines was contacted by detainees seeking representation, and she became increasingly concerned about the troubling conditions there. She joined forces with Vanita Gupta of the ACLU and Michelle Bran√© of the Women's Refugee Commission to investigate conditions and seek changes. Their efforts were initially hampered by a lack of openness and oversight within the Immigration & Customs Enforcement (ICE) organization. Undeterred, the three attorneys attempted to bring about changes in both policy and conditions, by making their findings public, encouraging involvement by activists and the media, and ultimately by filing a historic lawsuit. As these events unfold, the film explores the government rationale for family detention, conditions at the facility, collateral damage, and the role (and limits) of community activism in bringing change. The film leads viewers to consider how core American rights and values - due process, presumption of innocence, upholding the family structure as the basic unit of civil society, and America as a refuge of last resort - should apply to immigrants, particularly children.

When a painting is found to be missing from the store room, the boss accuses Stanislaw and gives him 24 hours to return it, or go to jail. Well, Stanislaw is innocent, so he can't return it, and he decides to borrow some of his wife's clothes and her wig, and go into hiding as a woman, Maria. He gets a job as housemaid, although his practical home skills are pretty well non-existent, but a succession of amorous husbands, difficult children, and eccentric bosses drives him from one job to the next. Meanwhile his efforts to keep in touch with his wife lead to her becoming suspicious of his involvement with another girl he is talking to, and then when he kisses his wife amourously, the girl is scandalised to see what appear to be two women kissing.

Stanislaw (as Maria) helps with the text, and this is so successful that the boss wants Maria to accompany him to the presentation itself. However, there is a snag: Maria would have to pretend to be a man! The boss finds an old suit and tells Maria to put it on; but he isn't impressed with the result and castigates Maria for making such a poor show as a man.

1477 ::: True Dreams (2002) ::: How many movies have you seen where at the end the main character wakes up, causing he and the audience to simultaneously realize that everything they witnessed beforehand was "just a dream?" This film takes that principal but instead of deceiving, the story invites you to watch the main characters dream away. With "True Dreams," Allen takes the term dream sequence to a whole new level: he lets his audience in on the joke, while they watch the two main characters run around unaware of the reality/fantasy of their surroundings.

Within the context of these dreams, we also see flashbacks of how the couple met and ultimately broke up.

But a few days before this event is to take place, the British governor of the island is shot. Her Majesty's secret service is called in and Sam McCready asks Desmond Hannah of Scotland Yard to take charge of the case. When Hannah arrives on Sunshine, he notices the subdued atmosphere of fear reigning there. An aggressive presidential election campaign is being conducted, but neither of the two candidates appears to be very trustworthy. The attractive widow Lady Beatrix Coltrane tells Hannah that most of the island's inhabitants are not looking forward to independence because they fear that either of the two candidates for the presidency will abuse the island for his own benefit. One of them, Tomson, is probably involved in illegal drug-peddling in connection with the Colombian Medellin cartel; the other one, Livingstone, is said to be collaborating with the Cuban government. Lady Beatrix' representations are confirmed by Reverend Drake, the island's priest, whom Hannah also discovers to be a strict opponent of independence. Ernie Favaro, a policeman from Miami, arrives on Sunshine. He is investigating the murder of one of his colleagues by members of the Medellin cartel. A hot trail has brought him to the island. The two cases could be connected, and Hannah and Favaro agree to collaborate. But as they have no official permission to carry on their investigations, they are in constant danger of being arrested by the local chief constable, himself suspected of corrupt behaviour. Shortly after the two policemen called on Tomson, one of the candidates for the presidency, somebody tries to kill them. But they are able to intercept and arrest the gunner. To their surprise, he is none other than Reverend Drake. He claims to have missed the target on purpose, intending to draw the attention of the international press to the precarious political situation on the island. After the arrest of Reverend Drake, the chief constable at last has a pretext for apprehending Hannah and Favaro for illegal possession of firearms. But suddenly, to everybody's surprise, Sam McCready arrives on the scene and identifies himself as the interim governor of the island. He takes charge of the case himself. Lady Beatrix makes certain insinuations which lead Hannah to conjecture that she is the perpetrator of the governor's death. Her motive, like Drake's, appears to have been to draw inter-national attention to Sunshine. But Hannah has no proof for his theory. Meanwhile, Ernie Favaro believes to have found a hot scent in the case of his murdered colleague. When he had called on candidate Tomson, he had noticed a valuable edition of Milton's "Paradise Lost". This is the book his murdered collegue had mentioned in connection with the Medellin cartel. Favaro is able to convince governor Sam McCready that Tomson's house must be searched. But the governor prefers the elegant British solution and pays an official first visit to Tomson. This gives Favaro the opportunity to pocket the book. In it, he finds a microfilm with incriminatory data such as the names, bank accounts, business partners, funds etc. of the Medellin cartel. Tomson is shot when he tries to leave Sunshine. The presidential election is postponed until further notice. Sam McCready, who has already become used to the comforts of a diplomat's life, drinks to Lady Beatrix health on her veranda. He is quite willing to let sleeping dogs lie where the death of his predecessor is concerned, and to ask the widow no further questions...

The film follows her closely during her dogged search for her unknown biological mother. Joy has a rather distant quality and the only times we see her animated is during her obsessive attempts to discover the identity and address of her mother. She clings to her conviction that she was the product of a loving relationship and that is why her mother called her Joy. This belief is all she has to hang onto in life. Her other activities revolve around her friend, Denise (16), who has got pregnant on purpose and is living in the home from which Joy was expelled because of bad behaviour, and her boyfriend Momo (21), a second-generation immigrant who was born and bred in Holland.

She has been directly confronted to the mutation which took place in the underworld: Brothels have been rendered legal with the paradoxical consequence that the business doesn't submit to any more laws. Prostitution is now socially acknowledged but at the same time has lost it's glamor, and the profits are no longer what they used to be. The number of customers is always the same, yet in Bern the number of women working in the underworld has increased tenfold. To-day, "Mrs Mercedes" earns in one month what she used to earn in one day. The documentary Lady Mercedes is a portrait of the prostitute Sylvia Leiser.

The film shows her also in her flat in Biel, where she is known as Mrs Leiser and lives modestly and rather lonely in an unassuming block of apartments. By interviewing her, by meeting with people of the underworld and acquaintances related to her private life, we get the opportunity of approaching the privacy of a prostitute, of understanding the meaning of daily and normal life for someone who lives in rather peculiar circumstances at the borders of society. Car prostitution is a remain of old days, coming now to an end. Only seven women wait for customers - the youngest is 55 and the oldest 74. They still work according to ancient rules which have now fallen into disuse. "Women of another stamp" as the police-constable says. Friendship does not exist in the world of prostitution, however they keep an eye on each other. The film describes the basic conflict between growing old and working as a prostitute. Sylvia is now 60 and doesn't make big money as it used to be long ago, when she would make a great show. With a touch of melancholy, Mrs Mercedes recalls the golden years, the age of mink coats, of American sport cars and of the illusion that this good time would last for ever. Today she lives in modest pecuniary circumstances, she might have become owner of houses, she says, but she preferred to take it easy. Time has left traces and a few wounds, Sylvia has built a wall around her: "perfect for the job but an obstacle in private life", as Martha Wigger, a consultant for the advising center Xenia, ascertains. An intimate and subtle portrait about aging as a prostitute, a documentary about a vanishing chapter of habits in Switzerland.

The military has realized that despite the most expensive and successful technological devices available to the armed forces, they simply cannot compete with the dog's nose.

With limited resources and under the constant scrutiny of the despot's watchmen, Saavedra and his team conceive of a bold plan to win the election and free their country from oppression. After fifteen years in power the result of a military coup in 1973, Chilean dictator General 'Augusto Pinochet' (qv), whose reign was marked by quashing any opposition through intimidation, violence, and murder, is pressured by his international allies to hold a referendum on his leadership. A "yes" win would mean eight more years of a Pinochet rule, while a "no" win would mean free elections. Pinochet, through intimidation, vote rigging, and what he believes is true support since the Chilean economy is doing well, believes there is no way he can lose. The referendum campaign will last 27 days leading up to the October 5, 1988 vote, with each side getting fifteen minutes of uninterrupted television air time each day for their campaign. The "no" coalition decides to hire Ren√© Saavedra, a young, brash advertising executive to spearhead their campaign, which causes problems if only because his boss, Lucho Guzm√°n, is an advisor to Pinochet. But against the general direction that most on the "no" side want to take, including Ren√©'s ex-wife Ver√≥nica Carvajal (who nonetheless refuses to participate since she believes the referendum is pure propaganda by the ruling regime), which is to expose Pinochet's oppressive ways, Ren√©, treating this project like any of his other work, instead decides on a softer approach, using the slogan "Chile: happiness is coming", bright colors most specifically through a rainbow, and a generally upbeat message of real happy Chileans doing real happy things in a post-Pinochet Chile as the center of the campaign, with no mention of oppression or murder. Beyond the tone of the "no" campaign, Pinochet and his forces have to decide how to counter what they eventually learn is a "no" campaign that is resonating with voters. If Pinochet decides to use old tactics of intimidation and violence, those working on or associated with the "no" campaign, including Ren√©, Ver√≥nica and their adolescent son Sim√≥n, may question if their lives are worth working on the "no" side.

Before he knows it, he is putting down roots. This one-hour documentary chronicles the unique challenges and rewards of saving a 250-year-old house.
1540 ::: More Art Upstairs (2017) ::: For three weeks in September, beer-fueled debates in the bars of one Michigan town aren't about sports and politics but art. Hundreds of thousands of people come to Grand Rapids to engage with blue-chip artists in ways that rarely happen at Art Basel or other established art events, unless you're a major collector or critic. More Art Upstairs follows four accomplished artists as they compete at ArtPrize, a populist experiment that inverts the equation of who gets to decide what art has value by letting the general public vote, via their phones, on which works will win much of the $500,000 in prize money - the largest award in the art world. What attracts these artists is the chance to win this public vote, but also to gain exposure to some of the country's top art critics, who dash into town to award the other half of the prize money. Local bistros, bars and abandoned buildings showcase the work and our artists are compelled to be outgoing. They stand next to their art, talking to people who are often experiencing contemporary art for the first time. They embrace the ethos of the competition but grow weary of having to repeatedly explain their approach and worry about going home empty-handed. Will this unmediated experience - no convoluted "art speak" explanations and no velvet ropes cordoning off the art - change how everyday folks think about art? Will it reshape how our characters make and exhibit their work? Will this populist experiment have any impact on larger conversations about high and low culture? More Art Upstairs melds humor, extraordinary behind the scenes access and a nail-biting competition to explore each of these questions. A quirky contest that's a mash up of Art Basel and American Idol attracts four blue chip artists to leave NYC's insular art world for a month in the Midwest, where the public votes by phone to decide who wins much of $500,000 in prize money.

1543 ::: Homeless in a College Town (????) ::: This documentary is focused on showing the two sides of Amherst, MA. The first side being a quaint college town, where roughly 20% of its residents are educated with a BA or higher, and the other side being the 20% of its residents who have fallen so low beneath the poverty level that they are now homeless. Both of these statistics, of education and homelessness are well ABOVE the state and national levels. "Homeless in a College Town" will display a variety of interviews exemplifying a series of studies conducted by psychologists at the University of California, Berkeley and the University of Toronto in Canada earlier in 2012 stating that the educated and cultured class, are more likely to care for "one's own welfare over the welfare of others". This body of work should open eyes to the fact that a community shouldn't judge itself by money or education but rather how well they take care of others who can't take care of themselves. Is Amherst one of these towns? Or are they pioneers, setting new standards in ways to help the homeless?

1546 ::: Green China Rising (2013) ::: Green China Rising is a visually stunning one-hour science doc about how the world's biggest polluter could become its greatest saviour. Mandarin Film produced the documentary from start to finish, raised finance, negotiated co-production partners, and performed all aspects of production.

1548 ::: "Type Cast" (2014) ::: Audrey and Corinne have kept their friendship alive through the years with constant Skype sessions, mailing care packages, and traveling to see each other every spring and winter break in college. Before then it was summers and holidays. Before that, their mothers just stuck them in a playpen and hoped they would like each other. It worked. With a college education under their belts, the pact was in motion- to move to New York and be each other's live-in support system. Being that they both always dreamed of an acting career, this seemed like the absolute perfect life plan. But surprisingly, these two very, very different ladies- through the eyes of the industry - are quite the same. Audrey is like a tall glass of water, with the temperament of one, too. Corinne is a box of fireworks sitting dangerously close to a rapidly approaching fire. Dumbfounded as they are, they keep running into each other at auditions. But that's okay, you just get home and call your best friend to vent about it. Wait, hold on a second. That person is your best friend, and you live with them now. Whoops. And that's what this show is about- Audrey and Corinne, desperately trying to balance this newfound jealousy and their lifelong friendship, the occasional or more than occasional sabotage, relationships or lack thereof, and the overall lingering black cloud of uncertainty- the mascot of feelings for actors in their twenties.

1551 ::: Hello! Shu Xian Sheng (2011) ::: The vast and snowy landscapes of northern China form the striking backdrop to the story of Shu, whose name translates to 'tree' in Mandarin, a clownish mechanic who resides in a small mining village in the province of Jilin.

He meets a fetching mute named Xiaomei who works at a massage parlor and decides to marry her, but this too falls apart. Meanwhile, Shu's village seems as doomed as he is. The film opens on a van saddled with loudspeakers, which roams the village offering consumer goods as bribes to townsfolk in the hope that they'll willingly uproot themselves to make way for modern property developments. As with so many rural places in China, a way of life is vanishing under the wheels of progress. Teased by hallucinations and haunted by tragic events from his past, Shu struggles with an ever-loosening grip on reality.

But when his flower is plucked eventually by the force of his fate, he discovers friendship, love, passion and finally hatred that drowns him, tearing his petals, under the water. (2)Phulkumar albeit aims for the subtlest nuances of emotion, is a comedy in the Chekhov's sense of the world - a visceral, inertly brooding study, of a children's coming-of-age in a half formed petit bourgeois limbo.

But the truth is too hard to hide - at least from each other - so they form the Geography Club. Nobody else will discover the truth about them as no other students in their right minds would ever join a club that sounds so boring. Their secrets will be safe from classmates. But are they? "Geography Club" is a smart, fast, moving and funny account of contemporary teenagers as they discover their own sexual identities, dreams and values and not merely live out their parents' desires and ambitions. Russell, Kevin, Min, Terese and Ike may not learn about actual places in their undercover social club, but they daringly explore the danger-filled, clique-mined landscape of Goodkind High School and courageously begin their journey in the exciting, still uncharted terrain of the human heart. Russell Middlebrook, a senior at Goodkind High School, feels like his father wants him to be an exact replica of him. That's why in testing his sexual orientation, he believing he may be gay, Russell has remained deep in the closet. Although officially stood up on a meeting in person leading out of an anonymous online chat, Russell later learns that that other person is a fellow classmate, Kevin Land, one of the school's star football players. Keven eventually makes it clear to Russell that he does want to have relationship with him, only on the understanding that they do remain in the closet. Kevin's own want to be in the closet is despite Russell learning that Kevin's parents would probably be supportive if they knew Kevin was gay, unlike Russell's father. Russell and Kevin believe they are being blackmailed by Min, a fellow student, when she catches them in an embrace. However, what Russell learns is that she only wants to introduce them to the school's "Geography Club", a self-formed club as a front for an in-the-closet or questioning gay/lesbian support group. After testing the waters with them, Russell does decide to join the Club. Beyond Kevin's efforts for he and Russell to legitimize their friendship in public but not their relationship, Russell being able to hide his homosexual orientation is threatened by agreeing to be the wingman for his best friend, Gunnar, which entails Russell dating Trish, an on the surface innocent girl, but who really wants to have sex with Russell. The Geography Club goes through growing pains of its own, with the two main issues being if they will be all inclusive, adding the most marginalized students in the school, and if they should make the Club official, meaning that all its members would be outed. The latter would have a direct affect on what happens in Russell and Kevin's relationship.

1810 ::: District Zero (2015) ::: Maamun opens the door to his shop, like he does every other morning. It is a tiny white container.

We are in one of the biggest refugee camps in the world: Zaatari, in Jordan. His shop repairs mobile phones. Maamun starts to serve his customers. Their memory cards contain their past in Syria: happiness, routine, family life. And then the war came, followed by destruction, fear and flight. Maamun rebuilds photos and sound, recovers lost content, recharges batteries, and restores the only link his neighbours still have with Syria. He and his friend Karim have decided to provide a new service: printing off the photos which have filled up the mobile phones of the people who live in Zaatari. Through his routine, the conversations with his friends and neighbours, the daily life in his tiny shop, we discover that no-one wants to print off photos of the war; there is much more to the refugees' sense of identity than that. They want to remember, they want to emphasise their Syrian identity, their identity as individual people. The photographs printed off in Maamun's shop every day not only make us ask questions about the identity of the refugees, but also about our own identity: who are we? Why are we here? Where were we born? Where will we die? We want to reach the audience by making them feel why a person has become a refugee and what could happen if aid did not exist (and what it means it does exist).

It tells the little known story of Peter Bergson, who tirelessly stood up against American Jewish leaders in the late 30's and early 40's in an effort to save the Jews of Europe. Against the Tide is a compelling film that documents what happened in the United States during the Holocaust, highlighting how a young activist, Peter Bergson, challenged Washington and the establishment Jewish organizations to demand that the rescue of Europe's Jews become a top priority for American Jews. Through a never before seen 1977 interview, Bergson gives a first-hand account of what occurred.

Robinson and Paul Muni, the more threatened and resentful Jewish establishment leaders became. Only the ultra Orthodox Vaad Hatzala, led by Rabbis Aaron Kotler and Eliezer Silver worked with him. Against the Tide addresses the attitudes of President Roosevelt and his senior advisors, who used the pretext of winning the war against the Nazis to block any Jewish immigration to the U.S. and juxtaposes the events in America with heart-wrenching heroic stories of the doomed Jews of Europe and the leaders of Polish Jewry who had faith that their powerful brothers and sisters in the United States would somehow be able to save them.

Cuban Film productions in recent years have been characterized mostly by a formal and thematic lightness, seeking to establish a clearly visible manner 'here and now.' Underestimates the average viewer with narrative entertainment facility that most elementary aspire. Disbelieve the claims of aesthetic styles and trends to contemporary cinema. He denies that which is different from the canon and official discourse. We need an auteur cinema, lack the voice generational dialogue with oxygenated and art that does not represent us. There are few spaces that support the production of new filmmakers. Caballos tries to reflect from the provocation. Its greatest strength lies in the exploration of form and expression. The function of art will always be destabilizing, but with an artistic arsenal. I think this film could be a revealing document of our time. Only then will we know why a horse is a beautiful spectacle. Fabi√°n Su√°rez

2019 ::: Not Me, Murphy (2013/I) ::: According to the project's Kickstarter, Not Me, Murphy tells the "simple" story of a man with dissociative identity disorder. It's part spiritual journey and part case study, narrated by Murphy's care-taking girlfriend Lynn. After a visit from her odd-ball mother, Lynn leaves Murphy, prompting him to take to the country with Brad, a mutual friend. Out in nature, surrounded by gun enthusiasts, their awkward-charming journey takes an unexpected turn. It's thrilling to study the very unwell mind, and to imagine its heights and depths without having to experience it first-hand. Dissociative identity disorder, perhaps better known as having a split personality, is frequently adapted to the screen [Shutter Island, Psycho, Fight Club] because it provides one of the rare occasions when mainstream audiences will stomach experimental technique. Cinematographers and colorists can paint mind-bending hallucinations, actors can play dueling personalities within the same body, and directors can build complicated stories without fear of losing their audience. Tamed by Hollywood conventions, we're ready to roll with the weirdness that comes our way. And Jason Yamas delivers. Until the final twist, Jason Yamas doesn't break his contract with his audience: we're treated to a harrowing but somewhat straight-forward tale of madness, while Yamas, his cast and his crew are free to play with the film's formal aspects. Shot on popular amatuer medium Super VHS, Not Me, Murphy's sharply defined outlined objects and spaces are filled in with milky shadows and grainy color. The light is pinkish when warm, colorless when cool. The cuts are jumpy and disorienting. We are watching some other family's home movies, edited together with an avant-garde sensibility. Sound, meanwhile, alternatively highlights plot points or overwhelms us with information. We overhear improvised conversation often vulgar, repetitive, or incomprehensible. It's a schizophrenic approach often seen from Harmony Korine and his ilk. Because these techniques give so much over to chance, the characters feel as immediate and as inscrutable as the people we encounter in real life. It makes their violent outbursts of compassion and sex all the more surprising, and pleasurable.

2066 ::: Shifting Gaze (2012) ::: Shifting Gaze is born out of the impulse to get close to the human behind the persona. The piece challenges self-expression and explores new forms of desire, breathing life into the medium and navigating on a new notion of choice, linked to desire and memory, choice being the present, memory representing the past and desire, the drive for a future. What we want (desire) is connected to or conflicting with what is expected from us (identity, memory), and choice is the act upon which we build ourselves. Underneath these mirrored imageries lie many stories about limits, freedom and self-perception: stories of the mind. A shifting gaze may allow us to interpret our interactions with others, from grasping cues to understanding other people's behavior toward us. Shifting Gaze is ultimately a piece about identity, making choices, a memory in act.

The documentary is tentatively scheduled to premiere in early 2002, ahead of the 20th anniversary of the disaster. The Ocean Ranger sank on Feb. 15, 1982. Part of the Network's expanded slate of documentaries and one of the first recipients of CTV's new BCE-CTV Benefits Package, The Ocean Ranger Disaster is the heart-wrenching story of a disaster that devastated Newfoundland, and shocked the world. In the early morning hours of February 15, 1982, the Ocean Ranger, a giant oil-drilling rig faltered and sank. All 84 crew members were lost. Now 20 years later, using state-of-the-art advances in animation, CineNova has re-created the events of that night. By blending filmed re-enactments, cutting-edge computer graphic technology, poignant interviews and contemporary archival material, The Ocean Ranger Disaster tells the complete story of the startling chain of events that resulted in tragedy. It not only recalls what happened that day but also takes us out "on deck" to experience the disaster first-hand. What really happened that fateful night? How could a seemingly indestructible rig sink? "By exploring the causes of this tragedy, this film is an acknowledgment of the heroic deeds of those who tried their best to save the men of Ocean Ranger, and a tribute to those lives lost and those left behind," said Bob Culbert, CTV's Vice President of Documentaries. "Hopefully, this commemoration will keep the memory of the brave men of Ocean Ranger alive - both among those people who shared in their mourning 20 years ago and among those who have come since and will continue to go to sea in search of oil," said David Lint, chairman and CEO of CineNova Productions, Inc. "We're grateful for the warm reception from the families and people of Newfoundland. Their assistance was indispensable to the telling of the story." Like the Titanic, the Ocean Ranger was the biggest of its kind - 25,000 tons with a deck bigger than two football fields - touted as an unsinkable oil rig and designed to drill in seas too treacherous for others. And like the Titanic, Ocean Ranger challenged the sea in one of the most dangerous areas on earth - the North Atlantic.

Are we living a lie under the charade of "an advanced and civilized society," all while we are destroying life on earth - polluting our air, food, water, and ultimately our minds, while destroying species, habitat and even human lives on a daily basis? Are labor saving devices, products and services for anything and everything erasing our true selves or simply making our lives "easier"?

2574 ::: Have You Heard About the Panthers? (2002) ::: In the 1970s, a new protest movement burst into Israeli politics. Calling themselves the Black Panthers, this group of rebellious young Mizrahi men was intensely critical of racism and class bias within the Israeli establishment. They embraced Robin Hood-like campaigns such as "Operation Milk," which stole food from rich areas in Jerusalem and distributed it to impoverished immigrants. Their bold moves captured the attention of the young and disenfranchised while earning the animosity of others (Golda Meir called them barbarians). Thirty years ago, as a novice filmmaker, Nissim Mossek set out to document the Panthers' burgeoning movement, following their demonstrations and ferocious confrontations with police. He and the Panthers had no compunctions about waking up families in the middle of the night to ask them to "present their poverty" to the camera, hoping to inform the public about the struggle for equality within Israeli society and incite others to action. Mossek's 1970s protest film vanished suspiciously just after completion; for years it was believed to be lost. The recent discovery of a copy in the Jerusalem Cinematheque prompted the filmmaker to investigate the demise of the Panthers. He tracked down surviving members to examine their sometimes surprising trajectories and their deeply conflicted relationships to their shared radical past. Intercutting footage from his early film with his modern-day research, the diverse, volatile and charismatic subjects (including Panthers Charlie Bitton and Sa'adia Marciano) cast light onto a lesser-known chapter in the struggle for equality and justice of Mizrahi Jews, and illuminate issues of disunity that continue to reveal themselves in today's Israel.

But when Sarah flirts back, Kristofer begins to realize he may have come on to the wrong girl. Sarah has her hands full trying to keep her random drug use within the range of an excusable cry for attention, but it's quickly becoming a real problem. Like so many troubles, a stack of money would go a long way toward making things better, but the only available cash lies in a shoebox at the bottom of Jessie's closet and Jessie's Dad is a cop. As these individual stories intersect and collide, heartache ignites into remarkable hope. Fall to Grace reminds us of the invisible threads connecting us to one another, creating a net to catch us when we fall.

2582 ::: "People in Order" (2006) ::: A series of 4 short films that arrange 471 people from around Britain according to 4 scales. 1. Age. A person of every age between 1 and 100. 2. Birth. 34 women from 4 to 41 weeks pregnant. 3. Love. 48 couples arranged by length of their relationship (in descending order). 4. Home. 73 households in descending order of yearly income (≈Å400,000 - ≈Å3,240) The concept behind our films was simple: we asked ourselves if you can reveal something about life by simply arranging people according to scales. Three minutes is a very short time to communicate something - too short to tell a story, or to get to know a character - so we wanted to make this series by setting ourselves some very straightforward rules, and then following them through over a long trip. The rules had to be simple so it would take the audience virtually no time to understand them. We established what scales we'd look at, and then chose how each film would be framed. Then it was a case of getting in a camper van and driving round Britain, filming as many people as we could over 4 weeks in February, coping with microphones crackling and cameras refusing to work. The experience was exhausting but also life affirming. In our whole trip we were struck by how happy people were to help. Only a handful of our shoots were arranged in advance. We relied instead on the kindness of strangers - and we found that everywhere, from deprived urban estates to rural aristocrats. The resulting films are like a list of government statistics where the citizens they are referring to have broken out from behind the figures on the page. The people on the screen stop us from seeing them as numbers. Even in single second bursts there are worlds of personality stretching out in front of us. The films are really about our awe at how big life is, infinite in its variety, even when it seems just normal to each of us living it. We are planning to make a feature length version of the age film - without a drum, set over a day - please contact us if you'd be interested in helping with the funding of this project.

Mr. Babcock and Patrick's longtime nanny, the timid Agnes Gooch, are to ensure that Patrick is raised correctly.

Despite the disruption each provides in the other's life, Mame and Patrick form a loving, supportive relationship.

Despite having engineering degrees, they decided on taking over the family business, started by their father, out of circumstance. In its heyday, Modernize, once the largest tailor shop in the city, had twenty employees, but now in an era of buying clothes off the rack, it is down to a staff of two, a coat maker and a pant maker, both who have been with the company for fifty years. In their advanced ages, Bill and Jack have to decide what to do with the business, they neither wanting it to die with them or having a family member take it over out of family pressure, without a want or aptitude of tailoring. And as one interviewee states, the number of tailors that are born in the city every year (to take over the business) is zero. Regardless, Bill and Jack's younger more famous businessman/philanthropist brother 'Milton Wong' (qv) has purchased the property across the street, the business' original site, for the brothers to live in retirement with a small storefront which they can use to continue a hobby business or to sell to whomever might want to buy the business.

Lee (II)' (qv), a faithful customer and an architect by training (a career which he has not pursued), has expressed a desire to apprentice with the brothers only to take over the business if he shows a true aptitude in tailoring, that aptitude which is not a certainty.

The issues with two and three are that they are only expressions of interest, and that J.J. and David, while having their hearts with Modernize, may not see the business as being a true practicality in their lives.

There has been great debate and arguments for nearly 20 years among and around Hollywood, centering on Independent Film. From Miramax and the Weinsteins to the Studios to the "little guys" to Sundance, the questions rage on. Who was responsible for the renaissance of non-studio movies? Has the Sundance Film Festival become too influenced by the Studios? How does the "little guy" who's made a movie break into what seems to be a closed system even for indie film? Enter a team of three neophyte filmmakers - Julian Starks, Jennifer Sorenson and Bill Jacobson - who embark on a five year roller coaster of a ride to find the answer to the two decades old debate: What is Independent Film?

Passion? Obsession? Stupidity? Insanity? Are these the qualities that help define Independent Film?

The "code" is the Hollywood Production Code of 1930 (also known as the Hays Code, so named for 'Will H. Hays' (qv), the first head of the Motion Picture Producers and Distributors of America), which was developed in order for movie making in Hollywood to run smoothly in the face of increased outside censors. The code was largely ignored until 1934, when its enforcement was overseen by 'Joseph I. Breen' (qv) who took over from Hays and who had a different agenda of moral purity. During those four years, pre-code Hollywood movies are characterized by their rawness and pushing the envelope of sexuality and moral ambiguity (with the depraved side often winning), which were not allowed under the code. What happened to the distribution of pre-code movies during the years that the code was enforced, the reasons for the slow breakdown of the code in the early to mid 1950s, and the reasons for renewed interest in pre-code movies later in the century are also discussed.

Instead, she places the island's narrative back in the hands of Haitians whose lives aren't reducible to headlines. And as her characters begin to heal, Felin suggests that the island will too. Felin taps into her past work in the documentary field, infusing the realities of modern-day Haiti with a lyrical touch. From its verit√©-style moments of Jaures the fisherman labouring by the beach to the theatrical scenes between muse Ama and her author, the film makes its fluid tonal shifts at a lulling, rhythmic pace. Shot on location with local actors and crew, Felin's film is an important addition to the body of work coming out of Haiti's burgeoning film scene.

Pictures hired the five primary characters to appear at historic Mann?s Chinese Theater on Hollywood Boulevard for an appearance commemorating the 60th anniversary re-release of the film for a new generation of audiences. 3,000 people lined the street for a glimpse of the recreations, again created by Corso and five of his team, all of whom next worked on the feature film, "Dr. Seuss's How the Grinch Stole Christmas."

2859 ::: Zielen van Napels (2005) ::: The incomparable splendor of Naples, situated in the shadow of a volcano and by the blue sea of an enormous bay, inspired Johann Wolfgang von Goethe to the famous statement: "See Naples and die". But Naples also has a more complex side. Behind the splendor and pomp that dates from the time when Naples still had great political and social influence, one can also find poverty and adversity. The film director Vincent Monnikendam ends in the backstreets and steep alleyways where sunlight barely penetrates, where dark drama and frivolity keep the age-old city in their grip. The central feature of the film is the painting The Seven Acts of Mercy by Caravaggio, the master of the clair-obscur. This altar piece was painted in 1607, commissioned by the noble founders of the Pio Monte della Misericordia, a charitable institution that is still active. Myths about this painting, the history of the Pio Monte, the joy and sorrow of Neapolitans, alternate and combine to form a colourful portrait. With a leading role for the city of Naples itself. Among the important characters in Souls of Naples are Pietro Gargano, editor-in-chief of the newspaper Il Mattino and a connoisseur of urban history, and Gian Paolo Leonetti, former chairman of the Pio Monte della Misericordia and a descendant of a noble family. The baroque interior of the villa where we meet contrasts with the sober entourage of the inner city. This is where the transsexual Gianni earns a meagre income by selling lottery tickets and Pina tells us about her difficult existence while she sews trendy handbags in a small factory located in an old cellar. The Russian painter Natalia Tsarkova tries to communicate in her own work the essence of clair-obscur in the paintings by Caravaggio whom she so admires. According to her, the special lighting effects with powerful contrasts so characteristic of his work are the symbol of survival, for good and evil, for life and death. In a style inspired by these characteristic light-dark contrasts Souls of Naples provides an inspiring portrait of a city that has survived for two and half thousand years.

From Nice to Prague and New York, from Montreal to Los Angeles and Paris, young escorts and "johns" share their experiences in a series of candid interviews. Challenging stereotypes and common beliefs, they tell shocking stories of love and hate, control and abuse, despair and hope. Without providing simple answers, the film invites the viewer to ponder human condition through the lives of its characters. Stefan is an 18 year old hustler from Prague who lives with his mother and travels around Europe meeting 5-6 clients a day. Phil is a middle aged man from Los Angeles who went through a painful divorce and began a relationship with a young male escort. Larry is a successful businessman from Los Angeles who has been both an escort and a client. The characters and locations differ, but the stories have many common motives. What drives these men to prostitution? Is it despair or hunger for money, solitude or low self-esteem, traumatic past or cold calculation? What do these characters think about themselves and their lives? How do they justify their actions, and how do they see their future? The first part of the film examines the lives of escorts as seen through their own eyes. The viewer learns about some shocking "secrets of the trade," the violence, fear and abuse that these young men endure while doing their "job." In the second part the viewer looks at the flip side of the coin. This time the story is told by those who pay these young men for their services. For some, it's the only way to get the affection and companionship they are deprived of in their lives, to escape from solitude and insecurity. Some have had devastating romantic experiences in the past and have never healed; some are just looking for instant gratification and "fun." We hear the particularly emotional stories of Richard (a "client") and Stefan (a "hustler") who were nearly driven to suicide by those who mattered most, and who did devastating and lasting damage. We hear about those who tried to help Matthew and Scott get out of hustling, with limited success. The characters discuss love and relationships and talk about their plans for the future. For some it involves having a family and children, some seem content with the status quo. The film ends on a compassionate note, with some final words from the characters asking for viewer's empathy, rather than a rush to judgment.

This is the remarkable, precarious, and untold story of a lost herd of elephants that live near the fabled city of Timbuktu. How the elephants survive in this seemingly barren, desolate landscape is a mystery. It is one however that Anne Orlando, a biologist from the University of California, hopes to unravel. For the first time she will track the elephants to uncharted lands and reveal the relationship they have with Tuareg nomads - a relationship which can be both respectful, and bloody. The lost elephants of Timbuktu are completely isolated from other African elephants - they were cut off from each other as the Sahara turned to desert centuries ago. They have survived in this unlikely setting by having a mental map of scattered temporary lakes and marshes. This is the Sahel in the West African state of Mali - one of the most arid places on earth and becoming more so. As drought has intensified over time, the elephants' wanderings between these vital watering holes have stretched into a remarkable yearly migration of seven hundred miles. The Sahel is changing fast - the climate is becoming drier and many Tuareg people are abandoning their herds and establishing sedentary homes around the traditional waterholes of the elephants. This, unfortunately, can only lead to conflict. THE LOST ELEPHANTS OF TIMBUKTU will be an unforgettable adventure into a lost world.

3132 ::: Splinters (1929) ::: "The story of the origin in Flanders of the "Splinters" Concert Party- later famous in the West End and on tour- is used as a central idea on which to base a topping performance of the kind for which the "Splinters" are renowned.

But the officer merely wants him to get together a concert party to keep up the spirits of the troops. How he gets together his troupe- an excruciatingly funny bit of business- and how they become a force of great moral strength to the fighting Tommies is a neat story in itself. But the main purpose lies in its facile use as a backbone on which to fasten some of the best burlesque, revue and musical farce ever staged." (Original Herald)

3186 ::: More Than a Game (1992) ::: Neither rain, nor snow, nor gloom of night...can keep these hoops junkies off the asphalt courts. More than a Game is a rollicking and oft-times heartbreaking account of Chicago playground basketball. Featuring NBA stars, local legends and everyday players, MTAG makes for a fascinating companion to Hoop Dreams, which was released that same year. Over the course of three years, filmmakers Joe Angio and Joel Cohen traversed Chicago's playgrounds to find out why so many people - primarily black inner-city dwellers - devoted their lives to basketball. At the time of the film's release, more NBA players came from Chicago than anywhere else; here, we hear from three of the best. Phoenix Suns all-star forward Eddie Johnson recalls how the playground helped him to steer clear of the notorious street gangs that seduced his older brother, a far superior basketball player. Former Utah Jazz all-star guard Rickey Green returns with two childhood friends to the South Side court where they competed against Arthur "the Magician" Sybills, who they all agree is the greatest player they ever saw. Future Atlanta Hawks all-star Glenn "Doc" Rivers - who would go on to coach the Boston Celtics to an NBA title - recounts a particularly transcendent playground game that he still considers the best he's ever played in. Of course, only a select few graduate from the playgrounds to the NBA. More than a Game also reveals the stories of those who didn't make it. To this day, Bernard Harden believes "no one man can stop me," but his NBA dream ended in the minor leagues of Argentina. His bravado barely masks a lingering bitterness. As a high school sophomore in Chicago's highly competitive Public School League, Terry Rucker averaged 40 points a game. He never finished high school. Lamaar "Money" Mondane's NBA dream never came true either, but he at least achieved a modicum of fame when Reebok selected him to appear in a popular advertising campaign on "playground legends." All three continue to compete on the tiny West Side play lot of their youth. And then there are the games themselves, hard-fought and competitive. One player crashes recklessly, headfirst, into a steel support to save a loose ball. A skinny teen soars to slam home a spectacular dunk, a play worthy of any SportsCenter highlight reel. An argument threatens to erupt into chaos when two players refuse to give ground on a foul call. (The instant replay proves inconclusive.) Witnessing this passion and intensity we begin to understand why the game is so important to countless players, young and old. Why, in fact, it is More than a Game.

3201 ::: Tal (????) ::: When Western propaganda painted a drab, gray picture of life in USSR, bohemians in the capital city of the Latvian Socialist Republic, Riga, partied hard, played jazz, dressed up in mod clothes and loved passionately. One of the brightest meteoric stars to appear in that mix was Michail Tal. Independent, brainy and a bit of a spoiled enfant terrible, at 23 he became the youngest Chess Grand Master of the World. TAL is the story of his loves, his brilliant chess conquests and painful defeats and his protracted ≈§war≈• with the KGB bent on keeping his genius in line with Soviet dogma.With an inexplicably magnetic attraction for women, Tal's bedroom adventures of ten put him on a collision course with both his family and conservative Soviet authorities. Tal's 1st wife, Sally Landau, a jazz singer and an actress whom he married the day after they met, raced with her husband across this complicated landscape until they both burned up in each other's orbits. After a wild and drunken period of debauchery, drugs, alcohol and another impulsive marriage to a young Georgian beauty that lasted for a day, Tal finally met Gelia, his life companion. Immediately, after they moved in together, Tal's wildness clashed with her desire for stability and normalcy sometimes with painful results. Tal's family's alternative lifestyle was a continual source of laughter, outbursts of passions and frightening brushes with harsh soviet realities. His biological father Robert was a wheeler-dealer black marketeer, his brother a skirt-chaser and his mother, Ida, a happy polygamist. In spite of the opportunity to defect to the West orchestrated by Tal's friend, a black jazzman, Alex Reed, Tal returned to Riga after each tournament. This was always his choice rather than the result of the constant threat by his KGB minder, Deputy Gagarin, to retaliate against his family if he did. In the end it is Gagarin who defects while Tal returns to the USSR crowned Blitz Chess Champion of the World. In the background of Tal's story is the rarified world of chess masters and the clash of cultures and political systems of the time.

3222 ::: Skin (2017/II) ::: Amongst the bestrewed contents of a tight-cornered apartment, a cold draft exhales from a defunct window sill. The leak of frigid air amplifies the restlessness of an unnamed woman. She tightens and contorts beneath her thin bed sheet, fighting to escape back to her slumber, but it is hopeless. The exterior world soon comes knocking as a battered cell phone alarms on the bedside table. Her bones tremble and stomach knots. She hesitantly answers, delivering an unrecognizable but otherwise nervous conversation into her bed pillow. Hanging up the phone she knocks over a glass of water on her nightstand. Hanging off her mattress, listless and defeated, we observe her distorted through the empty glass. The woman, involuntarily thrust into the undesired day, removes her bed sheet, exposing her full self to the escaping current. Her hands outreach, examining and stretching her perceived-imperfect body. In attempt to escape her self-torture, she flicks on the television across the room. It illuminates into the overdramatized expressions of a silent film star. The woman inflates and deflates her stomach, hiding and exposing the picture as well as her exaggerated impersonations of the character on screen. The woman soon finds herself in the bathroom, face to face with her nefarious reflection. Over her head, the bathroom heat lamp illuminates the space red. At her feet, the space between the floor and the bathroom door lets in the gelid draft. The tub runs, emitting a black fluid, like development liquid, into the porcelain bath. Soon, the liquid is overflowing onto the woman's feet. The woman sinks into the now still tub, and the picture sinks into an eclectic montage of distorted images; flesh pressing against glass, lights swinging to create twisted expressions, and skin stretching impossibly across the black. We return to the woman to find her arm hanging out of the tub. From there we continue through the woman's morning routine as she angelically strolls through her now Edenic apartment, captured by a series of distorted shots. We finally catch up with her as she hesitates at her apartment door. Her cell phone illuminates the interior of her pocket repeatedly. We slowly focus, from a completely blurred image to one of complete clarity, seeing the woman fully for the first time. She wears a mask of makeup, but is empty and drained underneath. Eventually, she has no choice but to exit. As the door slams behind her, solidifying her departure, we float backwards through the apartment, now feeling colder than ever, and landing on a lifeless, deflated arm, extended from the bathroom, as if the flesh beneath it had been removed.
3223 ::: A Crisis Within (2010) ::: Thailand is on the cusp of change. Since the military coup in 2006 that ousted Prime Minister Thaksin Shinwatra, the country has gone through a political see-saw, and become increasingly divided into 2 distinct factions: the "red shirts"; poor, rural Thais who benefitted from Thaksin's populist policies, and the "yellow shirts"; royalists, businessmen and the urban middle class who are appalled by Thaksin's blatant corruption and abuse of power. Now, the political schism that saw politicians from both "red" and "yellow" factions taking office, has culminated in a mass protest by the red shirts, paralyzing the heart of Bangkok for months and wrecking havoc on the country's economy. What began as a peaceful, boisterous protest has escalated and become increasingly violent: shots have been fired, barricades erected and bombs thrown into public areas, killing at least 30 people and wounding hundreds along the way. Accusations of murder are being thrown by both sides. The protests have also become less about Thaksin and more about the frustrations of Thailand's rural poor who feel their voices are never heard by the urban elites who've ruled the country for over 70 years. How will this crisis be resolved? Will the people in "The Land of Smiles" be able to find a compromise for the different factions? Is Thailand heading for a permanent change? Will the balance of power be overturned at last? We attempt to find the answers through the voices of Thais from different walks of life. We follow Pik, a "redshirt" from the North East as she goes about her life in the "red camp". We trace the journey with Yok, a "colored shirt" Bangkok office worker staunchly against how the red shirts are disrupting the lives of people in the city. We chat with Jojo, a student activist who believes Thailand needs to compromise or risk descending further into anarchy and chaos. We listen to Kraisak, a democrat politician dismayed by the violent clashes that's tearing the country apart. We follow these characters through their daily routine as the political crisis unfolds. How have the characters' lives been affected by this conflict? What are their dreams for the country? What do they believe to be the key to a peaceful resolution? Through this journey, we learn about Thailand's tumultuous history, complex political landscape and the extent of the divide between the rich and the poor. We ask whether beneath this chaos and disconnect, brand 'Thailand', a nation of people who love peace, each other, their country and their culture, still holds true.

3272 ::: The Gay Marriage Thing (2005) ::: Lorre and Gayle were heartbroken when they learned their two great-aunts - sisters who'd lived together their entire 80+ years - were on the verge of losing their 1850's home because it was too big a burden to care for anymore. "Having to leave your home just because you're older?" Lorre asks. "After living there 60 years?" Gayle adds. "Unfair," they agree. So they did something about it. Lorre and Gayle broke their apartment rental lease and moved in with a very grateful Gertrude and Germaine, to be financial, emotional and physical caregivers for their elderly aunts. "We were the Golden Girls for a while there, and we still call ourselves that, even though we lost Auntie Gert last year," Lorre adds. "But Auntie Germaine is still feisty and we do for her because that's what we've both been taught. You take care of family." With that, the first few moments of THE GAY MARRIAGE THING paint a picture of what it means to be a family. Gayle and Lorre, thirtysomething college sweethearts who marked their 15th anniversary a year after the Massachusetts Supreme Court ruled a ban on same-sex marriage unconstitutional, form the heart of this documentary scrapbook. From the protests outside the Massachusetts State House, to the churches of the Reverends Rich Wiesenbach and Carlton Smith, to the historic chambers echoing State Representative Kathi-Anne Reinstein's perspective, and to how all of these voices swirl in the air around Gayle and Lorre as they approach May 17, 2004, the first date same-sex couples could file for marriage licenses in Massachusetts. While eavesdropping on the emotional and spiritual toll this issue has taken upon all parties, the story carries forth to the everyday angst and anticipation of Lorre and Gayle's own wedding. THE GAY MARRIAGE THING is not some historical commentary on gay rights in the United States. It is instead a small story with big implications. By focusing on one suburban couple and the multitude of events that directly affect that couple's otherwise average life, THE GAY MARRIAGE THING strives to show a different side of this issue than documentaries or television newscasts have thus far. This tale is cinematic in its storytelling, rather than journalistic in its reporting. There are plenty of other worthy documentaries where "experts" abound. But this film is about the biggest experts of all, real people. With protesters and their colorful signs serving as a Greek chorus, and an array of opinions from church, state, and everyone in between, this is the film that family members can finally watch together. THE GAY MARRIAGE THING is the documentary that opens dialogue, fully expecting the audience to continue it.

While she and her loved ones address the issue, the characters learn how to cope with their own anxieties, struggle with independence and come face to face with the burdens of a fading youth.

Award-winning filmmaker Samir was born in Baghdad and has lived in Switzerland since he was child, while the members of his extended family are scattered all over the world - Abu Dhabi, Auckland, Sydney, Los Angeles, Buffalo, London, Paris, Zurich, and Moscow - with only a handful remaining in Iraq. Recounting his family's stories of departures and uprootings, in Iraqi Odyssey Samir also chronicles how Iraqis' dreams of building a modern and just society after their nation achieved independence in the 1950s were brutally dashed over the course of half a century. Loosely organized in three acts, the film begins with Samir's grandfather and his role in the struggle against British colonialism. The second act traces the successive waves of emigration as his relatives sought safe havens around the globe to escape from the series of coups and counter-coups in the 1960s and 1970s that resulted in the establishment of Saddam Hussein's three-decade dictatorship over the country. Saddam's deposition by the 2003 US invasion, and the iconic image of his statue being toppled in Firdos Square, signals the film's final act, and the last tale of departure. Weaving together the ironic, wistful, and witty testimonies of Samir's relatives with rare documents from private and state archives, Ottoman film footage and 3D technology, Iraqi Odyssey is a riveting epic that creates a genuine people's history of Iraq, at once humble and majestic. Shedding a new light on a grossly misrepresented country, Iraqi Odyssey is the veteran director's most personal, ambitious, and accomplished feature to date.

3640 ::: Hic rosa, partition botanique (2007) ::: Hidden behind the name of the most famous of flowers there lies a homage. To what? To the color red, to flushing women. To women enraged by justice like Rosa Luxembourg; to women engaged in the austere precision of an art of truth like Daniƒçle Huillet. Because - it is quite clear and the dates in the subtitles in the credits confirm it (1916/1936/2006) - the voices of one or the other cross the "botanical symphony" that reveals the images in sequence. It is the latter's concern for precision that is heard in the diction of the letters written in 1916 by the former. While Rosa Luxembourg is known for having been the heroic organizer Spartacist, who was assassinated by the police in 1919, it is another timbre than that of combative militant that resonates here. "Do you remember what we were planning to do when the war is over?" she writes to one of her correspondents. Such is the subject matter of these letters: the certain memory of the future. The hauntingly insistent reminder of the causes for which the struggle must be led. If a revolution is to be undertaken, and with all the necessary devotion, it is, to exclude oneself from a project bound to the rational. To what end then? To rediscover the gracious and inconsequential innocence of the original garden. To become animal or plant again, nature without fatality. Return, all in all and according to a familiar messianism, to Master Eckhart's famous mystical program "the rose does not have a why". In this first long film, Anne-Marie Faux celebrates the passion of unhindered floral existence without yielding anything to the demands that such an ambition requires.

3683 ::: Noah's Ark: New Evidence (2013) ::: Noah's Ark- New Evidence. Nearly everyone has been fixated on Mount Ararat as the location of Noah's Ark. The Bible states the Ark came to rest in the "mountains of Urartu" not "Mount Ararat." Seventeen miles south of the Ararat volcano two-thirds of the way up on another mountain approximately 8000 feet in height is a mass of cohesive convincing evidence that the ark landed there on Mount Mashu. Evidence even includes a 538 foot long impression of the ship's hull. Gilgamesh having visited "Mashur" described this place accurately. Heavy rains in May of 1948 combined with three noteworthy earthquakes exposed the ark impression from the collapsing expansive and loose mud that had entrapped it for nearly 2 thousand years revealing the ark impression standing up out of the terrain. Turkey oddly refuses to let archaeologists excavate to scientifically determine authenticity. You can decide for yourself after reviewing the massive evidence presented in this film.

3692 ::: Cast (2012) ::: In the "demi-monde" of night fishing, anglers on a French beach cast their lines. The camera follows their night-long toiling in obscurity, the contrast provided by the limited light sources resembling a scene from a baroque painting. Thus, a relatively ordinary activity takes on an otherworldly aspect, becoming an allegory for contemporary existence as well as for artistic production itself. For me, the situation evokes Miltonian-style scenarios of humans and rebel angels cast out of paradise and the film plays on Biblical fishing-related allusions (several of the apostles were said to be fisherman, and were described as ''Fishers of men'' and Christ was symbolized by a fish). Therefore, on a symbolic level, in the film the fishermen produce a ''divine'' signifier (i.e. the fish) which is subsequently disposed of, presumably leaving them to cast around for alternative significations.

3739 ::: Also Ran (2006) ::: What if your local football team was celebrating its Super Bowl victory when the referee burst in to announce that a small percentage of the spectators were unhappy with the outcome and so the game would have to be played again? That's what it felt like to Paul Mariano when he learned that 12% of the California electorate could undue the results of a legitimate governor's election, and force a special recall vote. Also Ran examines the bizarre world of the 2003 California Governor recall election; an election that was unprecedented in California history, and soon became a circus, with a list of 135 candidates that included a porn actress, an Austrian bodybuilder and-oh, yes, Paul Mariano. As a public defender for 26 years, Paul was used to uphill battles. He had made a career out of fighting for due process and defending the little guy. To him, the recall was fundamentally unfair and favored big moneyed interests. Paul thought: "That's just not right!" So Paul did the only thing he could: He ran for governor as Davis' surrogate. He promised that, if elected, his first act would be to appoint Davis as chief-of-staff responsible for the daily governance of California. Also Ran is a documentary that follows Paul as he launches his candidacy, fights to be heard above the din of Arnold Schwarzenegger's cacophonous campaign, and tries to make Gray Davis realize that his only hope for remaining in office lies with the quixotic candidate from Contra Costa County. Using interviews, graphics and animation, Also Ran offers a vivid and insightful look at the populist origins of the recall process and the way in which moneyed interests co-opted that process and turned its populist purpose on its head. Also Ran is both a serious and whimsical look at the hijacking of democracy and one man's effort to take it back.

Twenty-six U.S. homosexuals of various ages and backgrounds are interviewed, they who speak candidly about their sexual orientation in this era just a few years after the initial gay liberation at Stonewall.

Into their disclosed period, they needed to figure out where in society they fit, whether it be in relation to their sweet-hearts, to friends or society in general.

Director Chris Paine (Who Killed the Electric Car? 2006) has had unprecedented access to the electric car research and development programs at General Motors, Nissan, and Tesla Motors, while also following a part time electric car converter who refuses to wait for the international car makers to create the electric cars the public demands. As more models of electric cars than ever before start to arrive in showrooms and driveways across the world, Chris Paine's film offers an inspiring, entertaining and definitive account of this revolutionary moment in human transportation. Revenge of the Electric Car follows these auto makers as they race each other to create the first, best, and most publicly accepted electric cars for the new car market. Documentarian 'Chris Paine (II)' (qv) chronicled General Motors (GM)'s figurative and literal pulling of the plug on the electric car - the EV1 - in his film, _Who Killed the Electric Car? (2006)_ (qv). Shortly thereafter, a new revolution of sorts of the fully electric vehicle (EV) has begun. This follow up documentary focuses on four people within that revolution. 'Elon Musk' (qv), who built his fortune as the owner of Paypal, is now the CEO of newly formed California-based Tesla Motors, which only manufactures high end EVs. He is largely financing the company on his own money, the company which is seen as the initiator of the revolution. An unlikely person in the revolution is 'Bob Lutz (I)' (qv), the Vice-Chair of GM, the man who was largely responsible for killing the EV1. Now, he wants to be seen as the man who reinvented GM, perhaps the most important company to the US economy. 'Carlos Ghosn' (qv) is the CEO of Nissan/Renault. A pure capitalist, Gosn is betting that the Leaf, Nissan's EV, will be the leader in providing an affordable EV to the mass market. And Greg Abbott aka 'Reverend Gadget' (qv) is a leading EV hobbyist who converts existing gas powered vehicles to EVs, a hobby he wants to turn into a viable business. The road for each of the four individuals and their respective organizations to taking the general public by storm with their products may not be a smooth one, from external factors, such as the global economy, to personal issues being many of the bumps along the road.

Theirs is a dysfunctional family where no one truly communicates with each other, no one seems happy, but each who funnels their energies into an activity. Joanne cooks and bakes, and dotes on Angus to the exclusion of such doting on her daughters. Lindsay creates art - bad art - she who always believes someone is touching her face. Katy has lots of sex with several different partners, that is until she met her current "love", Rhett, whose religious beliefs do not allow for sex before marriage. Angus is stoically controlling, like his father. Angus also doesn't realize that he is manipulative like his father. No one relates to Jack because of the way he is. Jack feels he is becoming more liberated through his dance lessons, that freedom manifested by his golf, which he, like Lindsay and her art, does badly. As Angus is the escapee, the three female Snacks individually confide at least their feelings to him, they who believe he is happy, which is not the case. He lives with a woman named Julia, who he loves, but he has neither told her that he has a family, nor has he told his family, with the exception of Lindsay, that he is living with someone. As he feels it has helped him and in the next step of his son's emotional growth, Jack gives to Angus as a twenty-first birthday present one midnight session with his dance instructor, Rita. Rita's encounters with the Snacks end up extending beyond just Jack and Angus, those encounters which may not liberate the Snacks but at least make them acknowledge and deal with their dysfunction, not only with each other, but also in how they interact with the rest of the world. It may also help them in dealing with the recent death of the family pet, a dog named Busty, and understanding Angus' aversion to watermelons.

4011 ::: Color Bar Experience (2015) ::: A 2015 16x9 HDTV enhanced version for those who like it big and wide. Ripping apart the standard NTSC analog color bar signal. The NTSC color bar reference signal is distorted by attacking the horizontal and vertical blanking sync timing signals using a time base corrector. The resulting color bar chaos was rephotographed off a monitor since the video itself was too unstable to record directly to tape. This short video art piece was inspired by the 'color tuning guide channel' that American Cablevision included in its channel lineup in the 1980s. The odd thing about the 'color tuning guide', which was the typical NTSC color bar display, was that the average cable subscriber was not likely to know how the reference colors were supposed to look. Were any of them television broadcast engineers? So how would they know if the color display they saw at home on their sets was correct? How useless! So here is my Color Bars, which is my version of 'your color tuning guide cable channel'. Diabolical!

4100 ::: Firestorm (2010) ::: Every minute in the United States, an ambulance gets turned away from an emergency room because hospitals are simply too full. In Los Angeles, where the wait time in some ERs is as long as 48 hours, the entire 911 system is being dragged down in ways that are alarming. FIRESTORM follows the Los Angeles Fire Department Station 65, located in South L.A., a neighborhood with a largely uninsured and undereducated population. The LAFD handles all emergency medical services for the city of Los Angeles, and currently 82% of the department's work is medical-rather than fire-related. Ten hospitals have closed in just five years in L.A., and the challenge of delivering more than 500 patients per day to a shrinking number of hospitals is overwhelming the LAFD. With resources strained, and 911 being used for everything from heart attacks to stomach aches, LAFD paramedics have become virtual 'doctors in a box' according to Fire Chief Daniel McCarthy. Shot cinema v√©rit√©, with candid interviews and punctuated with stunning still images by Ed Kashi, FIRESTORM depicts the insanity behind a rapidly unraveling health care safety net. Award-winning filmmaker Julie Winokur and world-renowned photojournalist Ed Kashi show how 911 has become the speed dial for those who either don't have access to health care or don't manage their care properly. Instead of putting out fires and responding to life-and-death emergencies, EMS personnel are essentially filling a void in medical care and stretching themselves to the brink. So who will rescue the rescuers?

The film breaks a major taboo against discussing mental illness prevalent in Japanese society, and captures the candid lives of people coping with suicidal tendencies, poverty, a sense of shame, apprehension, and fear of society. People with various mental illnesses such as schizophrenia, bipolar disorder, eating disorders, panic disorder, and personality disorder visit Chorale Okayama to see Dr. Masatomo Yamamoto. They are men and women of all ages, with diverse backgrounds and various attitudes to their own illnesses. There is an elite businessman who worked too hard and was diagnosed with "burn-out syndrome." There is a woman who has suffered from an eating disorder since somebody said to her that her legs were too fat. There is a schizophrenic mother who abused and killed her own newborn baby. Because of their illnesses, some attempt suicide repeatedly, and others actually end up killing themselves (As of today, two of the patients in the film have committed suicide). Some have been dealing with their illnesses for decades, and have developed their own philosophy, religious faith, or artistic expressions. Some hide their illnesses even from their family members and friends, while others give lectures to reduce prejudice and misunderstanding about mental illness. When Dr. Masatomo Yamamoto, founder and director of Chorale Okayama, worked for a mental hospital, he questioned why the locks installed on the doors of the wards could only be unlocked from the outside. "These locks are not for patients but for doctors and staff," he thought. Then, he became a pioneer in the movement to get rid of locks from psychiatric wards. At Chorale Okayama, he tries to support patients so that they will be able to live in society, not locked up in hospitals. He created two kinds of workplaces for patients: Pastel, a milk-delivery service company, and Mini-Chorale, a small restaurant. However, the situation surrounding mental health care in Japan is not so forgiving. Suffering from budget deficits, national and local governments are cutting costs, grants, and services toward mental patients and institutions. MENTAL depicts various aspects and problems of mental health, showing such scenes as consultations and treatments of patients by Dr. Yamamoto, education of nurses, waiting rooms filled with patients, staff members negotiating with government agencies to maintain services, activities at Pastel and Mini-Chorale, and home helpers supporting patients living at home.

The Tophams have lived in Dunmow for fifteen years, but are still seen as outsiders by the Dunmow traditionalists, especially Miss Rosabelle Honeycroft, the elder domineering sister of the mild-mannered vicar, Hayworth Honeycroft. That is why Miss Honeycroft is so irked that Marjorie Topham has nominated her son, Basil Topham, and Basil's wife, Julie Topham, as the only entrants in this year's Flitch. Basil and Julie's young married life is not perfect as they live with Basil's parents, Marjorie and Aubrey Topham, and Basil's grandfather, Hillary Topham - which is a little too cozy for Julie's tastes - while their house is being built by local contractor Stanley Grimes, who seems in no hurry to get the job done.

They threaten to rape Rachel as payback for Miller having sex with Supermac's girlfriend Pearl (Miller had sex with Pearl as "trade" for helping her fix a flat tire). Miller reveals that Rachel is not his girlfriend, and Supermac releases her when a struggle ensues. But he manages to take Miller's prized pick-up and chopper. Rachel demands to know whether Miller would have let them rape her, and Miller shrugs that he probably would have if it meant saving his own life.

But Supermac refuses to return the truck and chopper until Miller has gone out on the streets to find the person that has the shipment.

On the other side of town, Supermac is back in bed with Pearl, showing some vulnerability and insecurity in asking whether Pearl has any feelings for Miller since they had sex in trade for fixing a tire. Pearl reassures Supermac, and they make love. Still on the streets, and a little drunk from all the Schlitz, Miller soon learns that Preacher was involved in stealing the shipment, and he forces Preacher to reveal that Miller's rival was behind the whole thing. At the same time, Miller's rival is apparently raping Miller's (ex?-)girlfriend. He leaves just as Miller shows up.

Miller locks him in a trunk. During the fight, the rival insinuates that he has killed the girlfriend (saying, "Nothing can bring her back.").

He gets on the phone to Supermac and tells him where to find the shipment - demanding that his truck and chopper be returned "un-mo-lested!" Miller returns home, opens a Schlitz, and sinks into his couch. Suddenly, the girlfriend's arm reaches down from off-screen, and she looks completely unharmed and ready to renew life with Miller. A horn honks, and Miller looks outside to see Supermac waving and leaving the truck and chopper behind. The girlfriend suggests they go for a ride and the movie ends.

The film will mediate between order and chaos in the universe and compare / contrast this with man's propensity for manufactured chaos. An idea I'm interested in is the contrasting natural forces of time and space and man's futile attempts to control his own fate. This philosophical outlook, man's vainglory, his over-reaching tendencies leading to catastrophe, has been an underlying theme in my films.

4195 ::: Frei Otto: Spanning the Future (2016) ::: Frei Otto: Spanning the Future is a documentary about the incredible life and work of Frei Otto. As an architect and engineer he laid the foundation for contemporary lightweight architecture, and his ideas are still awe inspiring decades after he revealed them. This fact was cemented when he was named the 2015 Laureate of the Pritzker Architecture Prize. In one of the final interviews given before his passing, Frei Otto tells how coming of age in the years surrounding WWII influenced his work in tensile architecture. Along with Buckminster "Bucky" Fuller, Walter Gropius, Frank Lloyd Wright, and Richard Neutra, Frei Otto was a visionary. His approach to form finding to solve structural as well as social problems is the foundation for modern architecture. Frei Otto: Spanning the Future takes architecture fans on a journey through a history of architecture that inspires the world of tomorrow. His fundamental knowledge of architecture's relationship to natural forces and a holistic view of the architect's role in the built environment is the foundation of today's tectonic shift in architecture. And as computer technology continues to advance, his methods for complex curvatures are becoming realized in our built environment, as are his broader philosophical concepts about solving some of the world's most pressing issues.

4468 ::: Baby Love (1968) ::: Poor Luci, she is a 15 year old English schoolgirl about to embark on a promising career as the high-school mattress when she comes home one day from school to find her Mum as dead as a door knob in the tub. You see her Mum has cut her wrists after a long unrewarding career as the town mattress. Fortunately for Luci, her Mum's childhood friend is now a very successful upper-middle class doctor who has decided to take Luci home to his family (on a trial basis). Luci's new family (The Quayles) has a few issues. The father's libedo is on the wane and he has a stick permanently stuck up his butt. The mother was "convent schooled" and misses the good old days of snuggling up with a pretty young girl. The son is an amateur peeper without the libedo problem but also with a stick up his butt. Luci arrives in the midst of all this with her one suitcase, a bit unbalanced from her mother's recent suicide, and does everything she can to fit in with her new family - more or less. There isn't a whole lot of nudity or explicit sex. I've read that the film was originally given an "X" rating but don't let that fool you. This was 1968. Many films which would barely make an "R" rating today got an X in those days. In any event, it was released on video in the 1980s with an "R" rating and the copyright was abandoned in the U.S. in the mid 1990's. The video is "Deleted" in England. Now 15 years old, Luci grew up alone with her slutty mother in a poor district of London. After her mother's suicide, Robert, her mother's former high-school boyfriend, brings Luci to his home where she meets his rich wife Aimee and their teenage son. However, Robert is not the boy's biological father. Luci makes Robert think that he's guilty of her mother's death, because he left her after he finished university. Nevertheless, she wants to stay with his family in their beautiful home. It seems to them that she wants revenge. The whole family is confused by her strange behavior toward each of them, which is interpreted as sexual advances...

4526 ::: Anyone and Everyone (2007) ::: Connected by having a son or daughter who is gay, parents across the country discuss their experiences in the documentary Anyone and Everyone. In it, filmmaker Susan Polis Schutz, depicts families from all walks of life. Individuals from such diverse backgrounds as Japanese, Bolivian, and Cherokee, as well as from various religious denominations such as Mormon, Jewish, Roman Catholic, Hindu, and Southern Baptist, share intimate accounts of how their children revealed their sexual orientation and discuss their responses. The parents also talk about struggling with the pain of their sons and daughters dealing with not being accepted by relatives or friends, and being ostracized by religious congregations. "It was so evil and so bad that we almost couldn't talk about it... You just had the idea it was so terrible that it was unspeakable," said a Mormon mother in the film. "Having heard all these awful things and what homosexuality was and then having a member of your family, a person that you have seen, a child that you have seen since the child was born, a person that was absolutely wholesome, good, kind, gentle and that put together with the word lesbian didn't add up," said a Hispanic mother. This film is especially important since up to 26% of gay teens who come out to their parents or guardians are told they must leave home. Of the approximately 1.6 million homeless American youth, 20-40% identify as lesbian, gay, bisexual, or transgender. Nearly 40% of LGBT (GLBT) students report being physically harassed.

4528 ::: "Family Feud" (1977) ::: The Australian version of the popular American game show. Two families compete against each other for cash prizes by guessing the most popular answers to survey questions like "Name something you would find in the back of a car." The Australian version of the U.S. game show. Two families of four people compete against each other over a number of rounds where they try to match answers to questions with those obtained from a survey of 100 people. There could be from 3 to 8 answers for them to match, but the number of answers generally decreases in later rounds. Each round begins with one person from each family facing off against each other. After the question is asked, the first person to hit the buzzer gives the first answer, and its position on the board is revealed, with the number of people who gave that answer becoming the initial number of points. The other person then tries to give an answer in a higher position on the board, with the number of people who gave that answer added to the point score, unless the first person's answer is the top answer. The person revealing the most popular or the higher of the two revealed answers decides if their family wants to pass or play. The family that plays then has to match the other answers, adding to the point score with each match, while avoiding getting strikes for answers that are not on the board. If that family makes a "clean sweep" by matching all of the answers on the board, they receive the total points (A minimum of 3 people have to give an answer for it to appear on the board, so a clean sweep will sometimes result in less than 100 points), otherwise when they get three strikes, the other family confers for three seconds before deciding on an answer - if this answer is on the board, that family wins the points, but it it isn't, the points go to the family that first played that round. The third round is a double points round, where the points for each answer revealed are double the number of people who gave that answer in the survey. Additional "spare questions" may be played, again at double points, unless or until one family has more than 200 points. This family then chooses two people to play the final round, where the first person has a total of 15 seconds to answer five questions, and after they give all of their answers, the number of people who said each answer in the survey is revealed and added as points. The board is then cleared and the second person is brought out and has 20 seconds to answer the same five questions - if they repeat an answer given by the first person, they hear a buzzer and the host tells them to "try again", hence the longer time (either person may pass on a question, in which case they get another chance to answer it at the end only if time permits). If the two people score a total of 200 points or more between them, the family wins the prizes on offer.

From sunrise to sunset, and often under the moonlight itself, we would sing our hearts out while working. I can still see us now, out there in that field under the full Georgia moon. Ours was a good life; we worked hard, ate well, and attended the little white church two times a week. It wasn't long before we were singing more than the preacher was preaching. People would come from miles around to hear our soulful songs of the south. Annie, who was always flipping her hair, could really belt out the notes, and Marty and I could harmonize like a couple of Blue Jays on a cool summer's night. Yeah, life was good. That is, until 1929. I was 14 years old, Annie 16, and Marty 12. It was the beginning to the end it seemed, or maybe just the beginning, but one thing for sure; our lives would never be the same!

At one end of the scale is Frank Sch√§fer, a barber and a shrewd and resourceful individualist; at the other, Eduard Stapel, an academic theologist who founded a GDR-wide network of homosexual associations and upon whom the Stasi firmly set its sights. Even though homosexuality had not been punished since the 1950s, the conspiracy of silence, the condemnation, the pressure to conform to society and to sexual discretion remained.

4638 ::: Takao Tanabe: A Work of Art (2010) ::: "Takao Tanabe: A Work of Art" is a biographical portrait of one of Canada's greatest painters. The film is both political and historical since Tanabe was interned in the Interior of B.C. during World War II and began painting in the early days of the American abstract expressionist movement in the late 1940's. His compelling canvasses were recently showcased in his first retrospective at the Vancouver Art Gallery.

Now in his early 80's, Tanabe is still avidly painting and continues to push boundaries in art.

4640 ::: Butoh: Body on the Edge of Crisis (1990) ::: Although Butoh is often viewed as Japan's equivalent of modern dance, in actuality it has little to do with the rational principles of modernism. Butoh is a theater of improvisation which places the personal experiences of the dancer on center-stage. The dancer is used as a medium to his or her inner life, but not for the portrayal of day to day existence. A Dionysian dance of nudity, eroticism, and sexuality, Butoh's scale of expression ranges from meditative tenderness to excessive grotesqueness. By reestablishing the ancient Japanese connection of dance, music, and masks, and by recalling the Buddhist death dances of rural Japan, Butoh incorporates much traditional theater. At the same time, it is a movement of resistance against the abandonment of traditional culture to a highly organized consumer-oriented society. An alliance of tradition and rebellion, Butoh is one of the most fascinating underground dance movements. "Butoh: Body on the Edge of Crisis" is a visually striking film portrait shot on location in Japan with the participation of the major Butoh choreographers and their companies.
4641 ::: Rumplcimprcampr (1997) ::: King Valentin and his queen desire to marry off their heir, the beautiful young prince Hubertus, and use a trick to determine which suitors are true princesses: they may not be able sleep without bruising on top of a single pea, even under a pile of bedding.

Some time after the royal wedding, the magician comes to collect on her promise that he may take his pick: he demands the nearly one year-old firstborn prince and heir, to become his successor, unless his secret name Rumplcimprcampr is guessed right within a day...
4642 ::: The Man I Married (1940) ::: Anti-Nazi tract laced with 1938 newsreel footage finds American girl (Bennett) married to a German (Lederer) gradually learning he is a Nazi, trying to get their son to America. THIS FILM is an apologetic about the rising fever of nationalism as Germany takes over the neighboring countries like Poland and Austria, and the Brownshirted thugs of Hitler's dictatorship threaten everyday Germans with Treason for ordinary political commentary directed at the Government policies or Nazi Party in general. It is very prescient about the fate of the emerging war and the Prison< Dachau, as well as Dresden and Goebbels, very amazing how the film-maker saw WWII coming. There is a married couple and 9 year old son making a trip to Germany to see the man's elderly father after ten years in NYC. A friend asks them to somehow deliver bribe money that will free his own brother, a philosopher critic of the Nazis imprisoned at the Dachau concentration camp [DCC], because he himself cannot leave NYC. They see the father who owns a factory but is a film director being harassed because his films depicted the brutality and ugliness being heaped on ordinary Germans by the brown-shirted thugs, things such as the people in the Czech/Slovak part of town being physically forced to clean garbage up off the street over and over again as Nazi thugs re-dump the same garbage out of the truck again and again laughingly. One fellow even asks to change out of his suit, and reappears in the WWI UNIFORM from when he fought for Germany as a younger man, still the German thugs made him clean laughingly enjoying the spectacle, as the couple watch. When the couple are reproached by a thug in a military uniform for not laughing along, their escort states the Czechs are too stupid to laugh at and they have to hide their actual revulsion. The soldier allows them to drive on and throughout the film there are similar incidents such as the father's butler spying and passing on any comments made in the household to Party members who try to boycott and interfere with the father's business interests and clientele. The husband and wife wind up changing beliefs the husband becoming a Nazi sympathizer while the wife decides she dislikes anything Nazi and wants to return to America. The husband tries to talk his father into letting him run the factory because the father is elderly and wants to retire and leave Germany because he is not happy with Nazis and what Germany is becoming with Goebbels. There the family strife continues as the polarizing feelings cause the boy to be caught in the middle. There will be no spoiler at this point so you can watch this prophetic film of 1940 call out what may happen in Naziland, and will happen in 1942-1945 well after it was produced. Amazing, actually. Light entertainment of a very serious topic. Enjoy it, I give it 3 dings out of 5 bells.

Xiaogang Ye writes the piece in four installments and ACM records each installment as it is written. The viewer can literally watch and listen to the development of the piece over time, along with live insight from the composer and musicians. From Xiaogang Ye's first inspirations for the composition to a musician having a baby born the day of a concert to fund-raising fiascos and unexpected illness, Composer Alive presents the human face of classical music and removes the intimidating culture which often surrounds it. Through conversations with such experts as Henry Fogel, President of the American Symphony Orchestra League, Composer Alive also explores how classical music scared off its audience, why it is hugely popular in China and how innovative and accessible projects will direct its future.

The problem for the police is that J.J. is the well respected Chief of the Northern Lakes Reserve and recently named Executive Director of the Aboriginal Tribal Council. However, there are no eyewitnesses to the actual shooting, and thus Cross is able to have his account as the one and only in the public consciousness, which he states includes J.J. grabbing for his gun, which resulted in the shooting for Cross to protect himself.

Milko, a driver working for the film crew, dreams of taking part in automobile races; his wife Elena is the cashier of the production. Maria, an assistant to the director, comes between them. The story intertwines ordinary daily lives with the world of filmmaking into a drama ending with Elena's suicide. The film crew witness this drama silently. Yet the shooting of the film and its story suddenly recede in importance before the real-life drama, a drama for which these people prove unprepared and which disturbs their inner equilibrium. To some this is an unpleasant episode that must be forgotten as quickly as possible, but to others, such as the scriptwriter and the director, it provides an occasion to re-evaluate their own lives and the films they have been making. They are shaken by the revelation that they have allowed life to pass them by in hiding from reality behind empty phrases and making pointless films. It turns out the equilibrium that everybody aspires to may all too easily turn into unconcern. At whose expense do we achieve our own equilibrium? The story revolves round a film production. In a town at the Black Sea coast, a film crew is shooting a movie. The screenwriter and the director of the 'film within a film' are shooting some pretentious trash involving a large crew. The relations between the members of the group are very strained and can have damaging consequences. They all witness a genuine human drama, which unfolds between the driver in the production, Milko, and his sensitive wife Elena, who is the cashier of the crew. The 'other woman' is the assistant director Maria - a beautiful and frivolous girl. In the familiar love triangle three people are futilely searching for balance in their personal and social lives. Milko and Maria are hiding behind a false self-confidence while Elena refuses to turn her back on Milko's adultery, which he sees as a weakness, and escape in a light-hearted love affair. Elena, too, is unable to fight against the current and commits suicide. The shooting of the movie goes on, though for the screenwriter and the director this is a reason for serious thought. They ask themselves whether they succeed in reflecting on the real problems of the people in their works. The human drama faces film people with fundamental question about truth and falsehood in art. The film is successful marriage of observations on various social strata and the confession-like tone of the filmmakers.

Pan, he said, called him by name and told him to ask the Athenians why they paid him no attention, in spite of his friendliness towards them and the fact that he had often been useful to them in the past, and would be so again in the future. The Runner reached Sparta the day after he left Athens and delivered his message to the Spartans. "Men of Sparta" (the message ran), "the Athenians ask you to help them, and not to stand by while the most ancient city of Greece is crushed and subdued by a foreign invader; for even now Eretria has been enslaved, and Greece is the weaker by the loss of one fine city." The Spartans, though moved by the appeal, and willing to send help to Athens, were unable to send it promptly because they did not wish to break their law. It was the ninth day of the month, and they said they could not take the field until the moon was full. So they waited for the full moon, and the Persians sailed to Marathon."
4998 ::: Mysfits (2011) ::: MYSFITS: We've Suffered Enough... Ladies standup! No more will we settle for anything less than what we deserve. We've been subservient for far TOO LONG, we've graveled at the feet of men for what feels like an eternity, these Vultures are going to pay... every last one; young and old will face judgment, a new brand of justice that will have every player and pimp thinking twice about toying with another woman ever again. Oh, yes, run for cover because the battle of the sexes has just begun in what will be the first Volume in an action packed trilogy that is guaranteed to have everyone on the edge of their seats. This cinematic masterpiece gives us a unique take on the plight of an exceptional group of women, who have formed a militant organization fueled by vengeance and utter disdain. These women have been scorned and they'll stop at nothing to take down all who oppose them.
4999 ::: Filmreg√©ny - H√°rom n√∂v√©r (1978) ::: A powerful, at times shockingly authentic, epic-length film about three contemporary women who also happen to be sisters. The film employs documentary-like style to tell the story which spans about 2 years, and is is notable for memorable performances by a cast of mostly amateurs.
5000 ::: Uebergeil (2016) ::: A Social Drama that took its influences from a documentary called, 'Loverboy Masche'. '[...] shows how high school girls are forced into prostitution. The documentary affected me tremendously and therefor I decided to write a script on this topic. [...] The love of her life and especially her obsession with him ruined her life. Thus I want to warn every young woman about vacation affairs and passing acquaintances.' - Jolanta Warpechowski
